abstract = {Clinical isolates of Escherichia coli with reduced susceptibility to oxyimino-cephalosporins and not susceptible to clavulanic acid synergy (n = 402), collected from Norwegian diagnostic laboratories in 2003-2007, were examined for the presence of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (PABLs). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for beta-lactam and non-beta-lactam antibiotics using Etest and Vitek2, respectively. The AmpC phenotype was confirmed using the boronic acid test. PABL-producing isolates were detected using ampC multiplex-PCR and examined by bla(AmpC) sequencing, characterization of the bla(AmpC) genetic environment, phylogenetic grouping, XbaI- pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typed (MLST), plasmid profiling and PCR-based replicon typing. For the PABL-positive isolates (n = 38), carrying bla(CMY-2) (n = 35), bla(CMY-7) (n = 1) and bla(DHA-1) (n = 2), from out- (n = 23) and in-patients (n = 15), moderate-high MICs of beta-lactams, except cefepime and carbapenems, were determined. All isolates were resistant to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. Multidrug resistance was detected in 58{\%} of the isolates. The genes bla(CMY-2) and bla(CMY-7) were linked to ISEcp1 upstream in 32 cases and in one case, respectively, and bla(DHA-1) was linked to qacEDelta1sul1 upstream and downstream in one case. Twenty isolates were of phylogenetic groups B2 or D. Thirty-three XbaI-PFGE types, including three clusters, were observed. Twenty-five sequence types (ST) were identified, of which ST complexes (STC) 38 (n = 7), STC 448 (n = 5) and ST131 (n = 4) were dominant. Plasmid profiling revealed 1-4 plasmids (50-250 kb) per isolate and 11 different replicons in 37/38 isolates; bla(CMY-2) was carried on transferable multiple-replicon plasmids, predominantly of Inc groups I1 (n = 12), FII (n = 10) and A/C (n = 7). Chromosomal integration was observed for bla(CMY-2) in ten strains. CMY-2 is the dominant PABL type in Norway and is associated with ISEcp1 and transferable, multiple-replicon IncI1, IncA/C, or IncFII plasmids in nationwide strains of STC 448, STC 38 and ST131.},

abstract = {Seven E. coli isolates expressing resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins were recovered from blood (n=2), kidney and lung tissue (n=1), and urinary tract (n=4) samples from seven patients hospitalised or recently discharged from the Divisions of Geriatrics and Pulmonary Medicine, Central Hospital of Rogaland, between July and September 2004. All isolates expressed a typical ESBL-cefotaximase profile (cefotaxime MIC{\textgreater}ceftazidime MIC) with clavulanic acid synergy. A bla(CTX-M-15) genotype was confirmed in six strains that were coresistant to gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. A bla(CTX-M-3) genotype was detected in the last strain. XbaI-PFGE patterns of the six bla(CTX-M-15) isolates revealed a clonal relationship. Bla(CTX-M-15) strains were also positive for the ISEcp1-like insertion sequences that have been shown to be involved in the mobilization of bla(CTX-M.) Further analyses revealed two bla(CTX-M-15)-positive E. coli urinary isolates clonally related to the outbreak strain from two different patients at the same divisions in January and February 2004. These patients were later re-hospitalised and one had E. coli with an ESBL-cefotaximase profile in sputum and nasopharyngeal specimen during the outbreak period. Clinical evaluation suggests that the CTX-M-producing E. coli strains contributed to death in three patients due to delayed efficient antimicrobial therapy. The outbreak emphasises the epidemic potential of multiple-antibiotic-resistant CTX-M-15-producing E. coli also in a country with low antibiotic usage and low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.},

abstract = {To clarify the factors for occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli in broilers, two flocks (1 day of age) fed a diet with or without antibiotics were kept in a broiler house sanitized with disinfectants. ESBL-producing E. coli, however, was detected at a concentration of over 10(6) CFU/g of feces at 9 days of age to 49 days of age in both broiler flocks. Therefore, this indicated that the antibiotics other than cephalosporins used in this study had no effect due to co-selection on the numbers of ESBL-producing E. coli in broiler feces during this period. When a flock was kept with diet containing antibiotics for 49 days in a laboratory animal room, no ESBL-producing E. coli was detected in the flock. These results suggest that the occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli may not be related to feeding with antibiotics and that the contamination of broiler houses with ESBL-producing E. coli might be an important factor.},

abstract = {Contamination of retail chicken meat by Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria likely contributes to the increasing incidence of infections with these bacteria in humans. This study aimed to compare the prevalence and load of ESBL positive isolates between organic and conventional retail chicken meat samples, and to compare the distribution of ESBL genes, strain genotypes and co-resistance. In 2010, 98 raw chicken breasts (n=60 conventional; n=38 organic) were collected from 12 local stores in the Netherlands. Prevalence of ESBL producing micro-organisms was 100{\%} on conventional and 84{\%} on organic samples (p{\textless}0.001). Median loads of ESBL producing micro-organisms were 80 (range {\textless}20-1360) in conventional, and {\textless}20 (range 0-260) CFU/25 g in organic samples (p=0.001). The distribution of ESBL genes in conventional samples and organic samples was 42{\%} versus 56{\%}, respectively (N.S.), for CTX-M-1, 20{\%} versus 42{\%} (N.S.) for TEM-52, and 23{\%} versus 3{\%} (p{\textless}0.001) for SHV-12. CTX-M-2 (7{\%}), SHV-2 (5{\%}) and TEM-20 (3{\%}) were exclusively found in conventional samples. Co-resistance rates of ESBL positive isolates were not different between conventional and organic samples (co-trimoxazole 56{\%}, ciprofloxacin 14{\%}, and tobramycin 2{\%}), except for tetracycline, 73{\%} and 46{\%}, respectively, p{\textless}0.001). Six of 14 conventional meat samples harbored 4 MLST types also reported in humans and 5 of 10 organic samples harbored 3 MLST types also reported in humans (2 ST10, 2 ST23, ST354). In conclusion, the majority of organic chicken meat samples were also contaminated with ESBL producing E. coli, and the ESBL genes and strain types were largely the same as in conventional meat samples.},

abstract = {A 7.8-kbp fragment of chromosomal DNA from a region controlling multiple antibiotic resistance (Mar) in Escherichia coli has been sequenced. Within the fragment is a potential divergent promoter region including marO, which contains two pairs of direct repeats, suggesting possible operator-regulatory sites. To the left of marO (region I) are one or two transcriptional units with three putative open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 64, 157, and 70 amino acids. To the right (region II) is a transcriptional unit containing three putative ORFs (ORF125/144, ORF129, and ORF72). Of six independent Mar mutants, four had mutations within the ORF encoding the first putative protein (ORF125/144) downstream of marO, including three different single-point mutations and an IS2 insertion. One of the other mutations occurred in marO (20-bp duplication), and the other occurred in a site in marO or ORF144 (a 1-bp change). All six mutations led to increased transcription of the region II transcript. High-copy-number plasmids containing marO and the adjacent ORF125/144 region from a wild-type source but not from a Mar mutant reduced the antibiotic resistance of a Mar mutant to levels comparable to those of wild-type cells. High-copy-number plasmids containing wild-type marO alone caused an increase in resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and norfloxacin in a wild-type strain. The nature of the Mar mutations and the results of the complementation studies suggest that ORF125/144 encodes a repressor (designated MarR) which acts at marO. The second ORF (ORF129), designated marA, would encode a protein, MarA, whose sequence shows strong similarity to those of a family of positive transcriptional regulators. A Tn5 insertion in marA inactivated the multiresistance phenotype of Mar mutants. The function of ORF72, designated marB, encoding the third putative protein in the operon, and that of other ORFs detected within the 7.8-kb fragment have not yet been determined.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacterial isolates is essential for clinical diagnosis, to detect emerging problems and to guide empirical treatment. Current phenotypic procedures are sometimes associated with mistakes and may require further genetic testing. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) may soon be within reach even for routine surveillance and clinical diagnostics. The aim of this study was to evaluate WGS as a routine tool for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance compared with current phenotypic procedures. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed on 200 isolates originating from Danish pigs, covering four bacterial species. Genomic DNA was purified from all isolates and sequenced as paired-end reads on the Illumina platform. The web servers ResFinder and MLST (www.genomicepidemiology.org) were used to identify acquired antimicrobial resistance genes and MLST types (where MLST stands for multilocus sequence typing). ResFinder results were compared with phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing results using EUCAST epidemiological cut-off values and MLST types. RESULTS: A total of 3051 different phenotypic tests were performed; 482 led to the categorizing of isolates as resistant and 2569 as susceptible. Seven cases of disagreement between tested and predicted susceptibility were observed, six of which were related to spectinomycin resistance in Escherichia coli. Correlation between MLST type and resistance profiles was only observed in Salmonella Typhimurium, where isolates belonging to sequence type (ST) 34 were more resistant than ST19 isolates. CONCLUSIONS: High concordance (99.74{\%}) between phenotypic and predicted antimicrobial susceptibility was observed. Thus, antimicrobial resistance testing based on WGS is an alternative to conventional phenotypic methods.},

abstract = {The medical community relies on clinical expertise and published guidelines to assist physicians with choices in empirical therapy for system-based infectious syndromes, such as community-acquired pneumonia and urinary-tract infections (UTIs). From the late 1990s, multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (mostly Escherichia coli) that produce extended-spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs), such as the CTX-M enzymes, have emerged within the community setting as an important cause of UTIs. Recent reports have also described ESBL-producing E coli as a cause of bloodstream infections associated with these community-onset UTIs. The carbapenems are widely regarded as the drugs of choice for the treatment of severe infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, although comparative clinical trials are scarce. Thus, more rapid diagnostic testing of ESBL-producing bacteria and the possible modification of guidelines for community-onset bacteraemia associated with UTIs are required.},

abstract = {Plasmid-mediated Qnr and AAC(6Ø)-Ib-cr have been recognized as new molecular mechanisms affecting fluoro-quinolone (FQ) resistance. C316, an Escherichia coli strain demonstrating resistance to various FQs, was isolated in Japan. Resistance to FQs was augmented in an E. coli CSH2 transconjugant, but PCR failed to detect qnr genes, suggesting the presence of novel plasmid-mediated FQ resistance mechanisms. Susceptibility tests, DNA manipu-lation, and analyses of the gene and its product were performed to characterize the genetic determinant. A novel FQ-resistant gene, qepA, was identified in a plasmid, pHPA, of E. coli C316, and both qepA and rmtB genes were mediated by a probable transposable element flanked by two copies of IS26. Levels of resistance to norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and enrofloxacin were significantly elevated in E. coli transformants harboring qepA under AcrB-TolC-deficient conditions. QepA showed considerable similarities to transporters belonging to the 14-transmem-brane-segment family of environmental actinomycetes. The effect of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) on accumulation of norfloxacin was assayed in a qepA-harboring E. coli transformant. The intracellular accumulation of norfloxacin was decreased in a qepA-expressing E. coli transformant, but this phenomenon was canceled by CCCP. The augmented FQ resistance level acquired by the probable intergeneric transfer of a gene encoding a major facilitator superfamily-type efflux pump from some environmental microbes to E. coli was first identified. Surveillance of the qepA-harboring clinical isolates should be encouraged to minimize further dissemi-nation of the kind of plasmid-dependent FQ resistance determinants among pathogenic microbes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of prokaryotic genome sequences becoming available is growing steadily and is growing faster than our ability to accurately annotate them. DESCRIPTION: We describe a fully automated service for annotating bacterial and archaeal genomes. The service identifies protein-encoding, rRNA and tRNA genes, assigns functions to the genes, predicts which subsystems are represented in the genome, uses this information to reconstruct the metabolic network and makes the output easily downloadable for the user. In addition, the annotated genome can be browsed in an environment that supports comparative analysis with the annotated genomes maintained in the SEED environment. The service normally makes the annotated genome available within 12-24 hours of submission, but ultimately the quality of such a service will be judged in terms of accuracy, consistency, and completeness of the produced annotations. We summarize our attempts to address these issues and discuss plans for incrementally enhancing the service. CONCLUSION: By providing accurate, rapid annotation freely to the community we have created an important community resource. The service has now been utilized by over 120 external users annotating over 350 distinct genomes.},

abstract = {To evaluate the diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) genes among food-producing animals, 48 isolates of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli isolates were obtained from rectal samples of broilers, layers, beef cattle and pigs, at the slaughterhouse level. ESBL-carrying E. coli were isolated from 60.0{\%} of individual broiler rectal samples, 5.9{\%} of layers, 12.5{\%} of beef cattle and 3{\%} of pigs. One ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from a broiler. The ESBL-positive E. coli isolates from broilers harbored various ESBL genes: bla (SHV-12), bla(CTX-M-2), bla(CTX-M-14), bla(CTX-M-15) and bla(CTX-M-44). The plasmid DNAs were analyzed by restriction patterns. Homogeneous band patterns were yielded in those of K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates harboring the bla(CTX-M-2) gene from different farms. No genetic relation between the 2 CTX-M-14 ESBL-producing strains was found by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, although 2 plasmids in these strains, obtained from different broiler farms, were similar to each other. This study provides evidence that the proliferation of CTX-M-producing E. coli is due to the growth of indigenous CTX-M-producing strains and the possible emergence of strains that acquired CTX-M genes by horizontal transfer in different broiler farms. CTX-M-producing coliforms in broilers should be controlled due to the critical importance of cephalosporins and the zoonotic potential of ESBL-producing bacteria.},

@article{VanMelderen2009,
abstract = {Bacterial toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are diverse and widespread in the prokaryotic kingdom. They are composed of closely linked genes encoding a stable toxin that can harm the host cell and its cognate labile antitoxin, which protects the host from the toxin's deleterious effect. TA systems are thought to invade bacterial genomes through horizontal gene transfer. Some TA systems might behave as selfish elements and favour their own maintenance at the expense of their host. As a consequence, they may contribute to the maintenance of plasmids or genomic islands, such as super-integrons, by post-segregational killing of the cell that loses these genes and so suffers the stable toxin's destructive effect. The function of the chromosomally encoded TA systems is less clear and still open to debate. This Review discusses current hypotheses regarding the biological roles of these evolutionarily successful small operons. We consider the various selective forces that could drive the maintenance of TA systems in bacterial genomes.},

abstract = {Enterobacteria on modified-atmosphere (MA) packaged meat (n = 54) and poultry (n = 32) products were enumerated, and 899 isolates were picked and ribotyped. For identification, 16S rRNA genes of representative strains were sequenced and analyzed. Altogether 54 (60{\%}) of the samples contained enterobacteria {\textgreater}10(4) CFU/g. In 34{\%} of the poultry samples, enterobacteria counts were {\textgreater}10(6) CFU/g suggesting that enterobacteria may contribute to spoilage of MA packaged poultry. The enterobacteria identified were predominantly Hafnia spp. (40{\%}) and Serratia spp. (42{\%}) with Hafnia alvei, Hafnia paralvei, Serratia fonticola, Serratia grimesii, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia proteamaculans, and Serratia quinivorans being the species identified. In addition, 6{\%} of the isolates were identified as Rahnella spp., 3{\%} as Yersinia spp., and 1{\%} as Buttiauxella spp. Percentage distributions of the predominant genera in different products showed that 89{\%} of the Serratia spp. were from products packaged under a high-O2 MA containing CO2 (25-35{\%}), whereas most (76{\%}) isolates of Hafnia originated from anaerobically packaged red meat and poultry. These findings suggest that the gas mixture used for MA packaging influence the selection of enterobacteria growing on meat and poultry.},

abstract = {We describe a model-based method for using multilocus sequence data to infer the clonal relationships of bacteria and the chromosomal position of homologous recombination events that disrupt a clonal pattern of inheritance. The key assumption of our model is that recombination events introduce a constant rate of substitutions to a contiguous region of sequence. The method is applicable both to multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data from a few loci and to alignments of multiple bacterial genomes. It can be used to decide whether a subset of isolates share common ancestry, to estimate the age of the common ancestor, and hence to address a variety of epidemiological and ecological questions that hinge on the pattern of bacterial spread. It should also be useful in associating particular genetic events with the changes in phenotype that they cause. We show that the model outperforms existing methods of subdividing recombinogenic bacteria using MLST data and provide examples from Salmonella and Bacillus. The software used in this article, ClonalFrame, is available from http://bacteria.stats.ox.ac.uk/.},

@article{Kluytmans2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The worldwide prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is increasing rapidly both in hospitals and in the community. A connection between ESBL-producing bacteria in food animals, retail meat, and humans has been suggested. We previously reported on the genetic composition of a collection of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) from chicken meat and humans from a restricted geographic area. Now, we have extended the analysis with plasmid replicons, virulence factors, and highly discriminatory genomic profiling methods. METHODS: One hundred forty-five ESBL-EC isolates from retail chicken meat, human rectal carriers, and blood cultures were analyzed using multilocus sequence typing, phylotyping, ESBL genes, plasmid replicons, virulence genes, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: Three source groups overlapped substantially when their genetic composition was compared. A combined analysis using all variables yielded the highest resolution (Wilks lambda [Lambda]: 0.08). Still, a prediction model based on the combined data classified 40{\%} of the human isolates as chicken meat isolates. AFLP and PFGE showed that the isolates from humans and chicken meat could not be segregated and identified 1 perfect match between humans and chicken meat. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant genetic similarities among ESBL-EC isolates from chicken meat and humans according to mobile resistance elements, virulence genes, and genomic backbone. Therefore, chicken meat is a likely contributor to the recent emergence of ESBL-EC in human infections in the study region. This raises serious food safety questions regarding the abundant presence of ESBL-EC in chicken meat.},

@article{Krol2013,
abstract = {In spite of the contribution of plasmids to the spread of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens, little is known about the transferability of various drug resistance plasmids in bacterial biofilms. The goal of this study was to compare the efficiency of transfer of 19 multidrug resistance plasmids into Escherichia coli recipient biofilms and determine the effects of biofilm age, biofilm-donor exposure time, and donor-to-biofilm attachment on this process. An E. coli recipient biofilm was exposed separately to 19 E. coli donors, each with a different plasmid, and transconjugants were determined by plate counting. With few exceptions, plasmids that transferred well in a liquid environment also showed the highest transferability in biofilms. The difference in transfer frequency between the most and least transferable plasmid was almost a million-fold. The 'invasibility' of the biofilm by plasmids, or the proportion of biofilm cells that acquired plasmids within a few hours, depended not only on the type of plasmid, but also on the time of biofilm exposure to the donor and on the ability of the plasmid donor to attach to the biofilm, yet not on biofilm age. The efficiency of donor strain attachment to the biofilm was not affected by the presence of plasmids. The most invasive plasmid was pHH2-227, which based on genome sequence analysis is a hybrid between IncU-like and IncW plasmids. The wide range in transferability in an E. coli biofilm among plasmids needs to be taken into account in our fight against the spread of drug resistance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the level of antimicrobial resistance and the occurrence of class 1, 2 and 3 integrons in faecal Escherichia coli from several animal populations variously exposed to human contact. METHODS: A collection of 341 faecal E. coli isolates was constituted from several animal populations subject to various degrees of exposure to humans: 18 animals never exposed to humans (living in the Antarctic or Gabon), 71 wild animals living in a low human density area (mountainous region of the Pyrenees, France), 61 wild animals living in a higher human density area (Fontainebleau forest near Paris, France), and 128 extensively reared farm animals and 42 pet dogs, both living in the Pyrenees. Resistance to antimicrobial agents was determined by the method of disc diffusion and quantified using the resistance score of BE Murray, JJ Mathewson, HL DuPont, CD Ericsson and RR Reves (Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 1990; 34: 515-18). Integrons were characterized by triplex real-time PCR and sequencing. The absence of epidemiologic clones was confirmed by PCR-based methods. RESULTS: A gradient of resistance ranging from absence to high prevalence (resistance score of 18.7{\%}) and a gradual increase in the prevalence of class 1 integrons (from 0{\%} to 16{\%}), both correlated with the increase in exposure to humans, were observed. In wild animals with little contact with humans, resistance, when present, was not mediated by integrons. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings firmly establish that the current prevalence of antimicrobial resistance found in animal faecal bacteria, as well as the prevalence of integrons, is clearly anthropogenic. The presence of integrons may constitute an adaptive process to environments whose antimicrobial pressure exceeds a certain threshold.},

abstract = {AIMS: To characterize the diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli isolates recovered within the faecal microbiota of Iberian lynx. The identification of other associated resistance genes and the analysis of clonal relationship were also focused in this study. METHODS AND RESULTS: From 2008 to 2010, 128 faecal samples of Iberian lynx (wild and captive animals) were collected. Eleven tested samples contained cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates (all belonging to captive animals) and 10 ESBL-producing isolates were showed. CTX-M-14 and SHV-12 ESBL-types were detected and seven different patterns were identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of unrelated multiresistant E. coli in faecal flora of captive specimens of Iberian lynx, including the presence of ESBLs, resistant genes in integrons and virulence determinants was showed in this study. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results obtained in this study highlight the environmental problem as future reintroductions of Iberian lynx could lead to a spread of resistant bacteria. Additionally, ESBL-producing bacteria can represent a health problem for this endangered species.},

abstract = {Spontaneous mutations are stochastic events. The mutation rate, defined as mutations per genome per replication, is generally very low, and it is widely accepted that spontaneous mutations occur at defined, but different, rates in bacteriophage and in bacterial, insect, and mammalian cells. The calculation of mutation rates has proved to be a significant problem. Mutation rates can be calculated by following mutant accumulation during growth or from the distribution of mutants obtained in parallel cultures. As Luria and Delbr{\"{u}}ck described in 1943, the number of mutants in parallel populations of bacterial cells varies widely depending on when a spontaneous mutation occurs during growth of the culture. Since 1943, many mathematical refinements to estimating rates, called estimators, have been described to facilitate determination of the mutation rate from the distribution or frequency of mutants detected following growth of parallel cultures. We present a rigorous mathematical solution to the mutation rate problem using an unbiased and consistent estimator. Using this estimator we demonstrate experimentally that mutation rates can be easily calculated by determining mutant accumulation, that is, from the number of mutants measured in two successive generations. Moreover, to verify the consistency of our estimator we conduct a series of simulation trials that show a surprisingly rapid convergence to the targeted mutation rate (reached between 25th and 30th generations). {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Fluoroquinolone resistance can cause major clinical problems. Here, we investigated fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms in a clinical Escherichia coli isolate, HUE1, which had no mutations quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. HUE1 demonstrated MICs that exceeded the breakpoints for ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and norfloxacin. HUE1 harbored oqxAB and qnrS1 on distinct plasmids. In addition, it exhibited lower intracellular ciprofloxacin concentrations and higher mRNA expression levels of efflux pumps and their global activators than did reference strains. The genes encoding AcrR (local AcrAB repressor) and MarR (MarA repressor) were disrupted by insertion of the transposon IS3-IS629 and a frameshift mutation, respectively. A series of mutants derived from HUE1 were obtained by plasmid curing and gene knockout using homologous recombination. Compared to the MICs of the parent strain HUE1, the fluoroquinolone MICs of these mutants indicated that qnrS1, oqxAB, acrAB, acrF, acrD, mdtK, mdfA, and tolC contributed to the reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolone in HUE1. Therefore, fluoroquinolone resistance in HUE1 is caused by concomitant acquisition of QnrS1 and OqxAB and overexpression of AcrAB-TolC and other chromosome-encoded efflux pumps. Thus, we have demonstrated that QRDR mutations are not absolutely necessary for acquiring fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli.},

abstract = {One of the currently most relevant resistance mechanisms in Enterobacteriaceae is the production of enzymes that lead to modern expanded-spectrum cephalosporin and even carbapenem resistance, mainly extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases. A worrisome aspect is the spread of ESBL and carbapenemase producers into the environment. The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence of ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and to further characterize ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in rivers and lakes in Switzerland. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 21 (36.2{\%}) of the 58 bodies of water sampled. One river sample tested positive for a carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strain. Seventy-four individual strains expressing an ESBL phenotype were isolated. Species identification revealed 60 Escherichia coli strains, seven Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strains, five Raoultella planticola strains, one Enterobacter cloacae strain, and one Enterobacter amnigenus strain. Three strains were identified as SHV-12 ESBL producers, and 71 strains carried genes encoding CTX-M ESBLs. Of the 71 strains with CTX-M ESBL genes, 8 isolates expressed CTX-M-1, three produced CTX-M-3, 46 produced CTX-M-15, three produced CTX-M-55, one produced CTX-M-79, six produced CTX-M-14, and four produced CTX-M-27. Three of the four CTX-M-27 producers belonged to the multiresistant pandemic sequence type E. coli B2:ST131 that is strongly associated with potentially severe infections in humans and animals.},

abstract = {Global trade and mobility of people has increased rapidly over the last 20 years. This has had profound consequences for the evolution and the movement of antibiotic resistance genes. There is increasing exposure of populations all around the world to resistant bacteria arising in the emerging economies. Arguably the most important development of the last two decades in the field of antibiotic resistance is the emergence and spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) of the CTX-M group. A consequence of the very high rates of ESBL production among Enterobacteriaceae in Asian countries is that there is a substantial use of carbapenem antibiotics, resulting in the emergence of plasmid-mediated resistance to carbapenems. This article reviews the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, focuses on three particular carbapenemases--imipenem carbapenemases, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase, and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase--and highlights the importance of control of antibiotic use.},

abstract = {Fifteen cases of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157 infection were associated with the consumption of contaminated food from two related butchers' premises in the north-east of England. Ten cases were admitted to hospital and seven cases developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome. A case control study found a statistically significant association with the purchase of raw and/or ready-to-eat (RTE) food supplied by the implicated butchers' shops. Isolates of STEC O157 were detected in two raw lamb burgers taken from one of the butchers' premises. Subsequent environmental sampling identified STEC O157 in bovine faecal samples on the farm supplying cattle to the implicated butchers for slaughter. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform on all cultures isolated from humans, food and cattle during the investigation. Quality trimmed Illumina reads were mapped to the STEC O157 reference genome Sakai using bwa-mem, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using gatk2. Analysis of the core genome SNP positions ({\textgreater}90â{\%}âconsensus, minimum depth 10Ã, mapping quality (MQ)â¥30) revealed that all isolates from humans, food and cattle differed by two SNPs. WGS analysis provided forensic-level microbiological evidence to support the epidemiological links between the farm, the butchers' premises and the clinical cases. Cross-contamination from raw meat to RTE foods at the butchers' premises was the most plausible transmission route. The evidence presented here highlights the importance of taking measures to mitigate the risks of cross-contamination in this setting.},

MICs were determined using a microdilution procedure. All examined taxa were naturally sensitive/intermediate toward tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, some penicillins (amoxycillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin [with and without tazobactam], mezlocillin, azlocillin), cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, quinolones, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol and were naturally resistant/intermediate toward benzylpenicillin, oxacillin, macrolides, lincosamides, glycopeptides, rifampicin, and fusidic acid.No differences in natural antibiotic susceptibility were seen between enterohemorrhagic and other E. coli strains. Likewise, with one exception, no significant differences in natural antibiotic susceptibility were seen either among the Shigella subgroups or between Shigella and E. coli. The natural population of S. flexneri was slightly more susceptible to chloramphenicol than the natural populations of other taxa within the Shigella-E. coli complex. E. vulneris and E. hermannii showed susceptibility patterns to many antibiotics similar to Shigella and E. coli, but there were other antibiotics toward which there were significant differences in natural susceptibility. E. vulneris and E. hermannii were less susceptible to nitrofurantoin and slightly more susceptible to several aminoglycosides than E. coli and Shigella. E. hermannii was the only species that was naturally resistant/intermediate to ticarcillin and amoxycillin (DIN standard). The addition of clavulanic acid to the latter resulted in a decrease of seven twofold dilution steps (E. vulneris: four twofold dilution steps, E. coli/Shigella: two twofold dilution steps) of the MICs of the natural population. With the exception of cefoperazone and cefepime, E. hermannii was more susceptible to cephalosporins than strains of the other species. E. vulneris was the species most susceptible to ticarcillin and the only species that was highly resistant to fosfomycin (MIC {\textgreater} 256 $\mu$g/mL). The antibiotic susceptibility to fosfomycin was also unique for E. hermannii (MIC 32-128 $\mu$g/mL), whereas the natural populations of E. coli and Shigella showed lower MIC values.The data of this study represent an assessment of the natural susceptibility of strains of Escherichia spp. and Shigella subgroups to a wide range of antibiotics. These databases can be used for the validation of antibiotic susceptibility test results of Escherichia spp. and shigellae. The conformity of the natural antibiotic susceptibility test results not only among the Shigella subgroups but also between Shigella and E. coli support the status of Shigella as a subgroup of the species E. coli.

abstract = {In the 1960s-1980s, determination of bacterial growth rates was an important tool in microbial genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and microbial physiology. The exciting technical developments of the 1990s and the 2000s eclipsed that tool; as a result, many investigators today lack experience with growth rate measurements. Recently, investigators in a number of areas have started to use measurements of bacterial growth rates for a variety of purposes. Those measurements have been greatly facilitated by the availability of microwell plate readers that permit the simultaneous measurements on up to 384 different cultures. Only the exponential (logarithmic) portions of the resulting growth curves are useful for determining growth rates, and manual determination of that portion and calculation of growth rates can be tedious for high-throughput purposes. Here, we introduce the program GrowthRates that uses plate reader output files to automatically determine the exponential portion of the curve and to automatically calculate the growth rate, the maximum culture density, and the duration of the growth lag phase. GrowthRates is freely available for Macintosh, Windows, and Linux. We discuss the effects of culture volume, the classical bacterial growth curve, and the differences between determinations in rich media and minimal (mineral salts) media. This protocol covers calibration of the plate reader, growth of culture inocula for both rich and minimal media, and experimental setup. As a guide to reliability, we report typical day-to-day variation in growth rates and variation within experiments with respect to position of wells within the plates.},

METHODS: A PCR-based strategy was used to obtain qnr-like genes of reference strains of Vibrio vulnificus CIP103196, Vibrio parahaemolyticus CIP71.2 and Photobacterium profundum CIP106289 that were sequenced, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. MICs of quinolones were determined for these reference strains and an E. coli reference strain harbouring recombinant plasmids. RESULTS: The Qnr-like proteins of these Vibrionaceae bacterial species shared 40-67{\%} amino acid identity with the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants QnrA, QnrB and QnrS with a series of highly conserved residues. Once cloned in E. coli they conferred reduced susceptibility to quinolones. CONCLUSIONS: This work provides further evidence that water-borne Vibrionaceae may constitute a reservoir for Qnr-like quinolone resistance determinants.},

Overall, 25.4{\%} of the vegetable samples yielded one or more ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, 78.3{\%} of which were multidrug resistant. Sixty isolates were obtained: Escherichia coli, 26; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Enterobacter aerogenes, 1; and Cronobacter sakazakii, 1. We found 29 isolates producing CTX-M-15, 8 producing CTX-M-14, 7 producing CTX-M-55, 3 producing CTX-M-65, 1 each producing CTX-M-1, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-27, and CTX-M-63, 5 producing SHV-2, 3 producing SHV-12, and 1 producing SHV-2a. Four of the E. coli isolates belonged to epidemiologically important clones: CTX-M-15-producing B2:ST131 (1 isolate), D:ST405 (1 isolate), and D:ST38 (2 isolates). One of the D:ST38 isolates belonged to the extraintestinal enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) D:ST38 lineage. Two of the K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to the epidemic clones sequence type 15 (ST15) and ST147. The occurrence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic and commensal Enterobacteriaceae in imported agricultural foodstuffs constitutes a source of ESBL genes and a concern for food safety.},

abstract = {The evolutionary history of a set of species is usually described by a rooted phylogenetic tree. Although it is generally undisputed that bifurcating speciation events and descent with modifications are major forces of evolution, there is a growing belief that reticulate events also have a role to play. Phylogenetic networks provide an alternative to phylogenetic trees and may be more suitable for data sets where evolution involves significant amounts of reticulate events, such as hybridization, horizontal gene transfer, or recombination. In this article, we give an introduction to the topic of phylogenetic networks, very briefly describing the fundamental concepts and summarizing some of the most important combinatorial methods that are available for their computation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate correlations between antimicrobial use and the prevalence of resistance in commensal Escherichia coli isolates from pigs, poultry and cattle, using data from publicly available national or international reports from seven European countries. METHODS: The link between the quantities of different classes of antimicrobials administered to food-producing animals per country (expressed in mg/population correction unit) and the prevalence of resistance to the different antimicrobial classes (interpreted by EUCAST epidemiological cut-off values) in E. coli isolates (4831 isolates in total) was assessed by means of polynomial regression analysis and determination of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS: A quadratic regression best fitted the antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance data. The coefficient of determination was, in decreasing order, 0.99 for fluoroquinolones and amphenicols, 0.94 for third-generation cephalosporins and sulphonamides, 0.93 for aminopenicillins, 0.86 for fluoroquinolones, 0.81 for streptomycin and 0.80 for gentamicin and tetracycline. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 1 for amphenicols, 0.96 for sulphonamides, 0.93 for streptomycin and tetracycline, 0.89 for aminopenicillins, 0.71 for gentamicin and 0.70 for third-generation cephalosporins. CONCLUSIONS: These remarkably high coefficients indicate that, at a national level, the level of use of specific antimicrobials strongly correlates to the level of resistance towards these agents in commensal E. coli isolates in pigs, poultry and cattle. However, data restraints reveal the need for further detail in collection and harmonization of antimicrobial resistance and use data in Europe.},

abstract = {During recent years a rapid increase of quinolone resistant Escherichia coli have been noted in the Swedish broiler population, despite the lack of a known selective pressure. The current study wanted to investigate if imported breeding birds could be a source for the quinolone resistant E. coli. The occurrence of quinolone resistant E. coli was investigated, using selective cultivation with nalidixic acid, in grand-parent birds on arrival to Sweden and their progeny. In addition, sampling in hatcheries and empty cleaned poultry houses was performed. Clonality of isolates was investigated using a 10-loci multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). To identify the genetic basis for the resistance isolates were also analysed for occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants and characterization of chromosomal mutations. E. coli resistant to nalidixic acid occurred in grandparent birds imported to Sweden for breeding purposes. Four predominant MLVA types were identified in isolates from grandparent birds, parent birds and broilers. However, resistant E. coli with identical MLVA patterns were also present in hatcheries and poultry houses suggesting that the environment plays a role in the occurrence. Nalidixic acid resistance was due to a mutation in the gyrA gene and no PMQR could be identified. The occurrence of identical clones in all levels of the production pyramid points to that quinolone resistant E. coli can be introduced through imported breeding birds and spread by vertical transmission to all levels of the broiler production pyramid.},

In this study the prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in stool samples from ambulatory patients who presented in the emergency department of the University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf with gastrointestinal complains and in chicken meat samples from the Hamburg region were analysed and compared with respect to ESBL-genotypes, sequence types and antibiotic resistance profiles. Twenty-nine (4.1{\%}) of 707 stool samples and 72 (60{\%}) of 120 chicken meat samples were positive for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The distribution of ESBL genes in the stool vs. chicken meat isolates (given as {\%} of total isolates from stool vs. chicken meat) was as follows: CTX-M-15 (38{\%} vs. 0{\%}), CTX-M-14 (17{\%} vs. 6{\%}), CTX-M-1 (17{\%} vs. 69{\%}), SHV-12 (3{\%} vs. 18{\%}) and TEM-52 (3{\%} each). Comparison of ESBL- and multilocus sequence type revealed no correlation between isolates of human and chicken. Furthermore, ESBL-producing E. coli from stool samples were significantly more resistant to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and/or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than chicken isolates. The differences in ESBL-genotypes, sequence types and antibiotic resistance patterns indicate that in our clinical setting chicken meat is not a major contributor to human colonization with ESBL-carrying Enterobacteriaceae.},

Here, to meet this need, we draw on the successes of MLST and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to propose a hierarchical gene-by-gene approach that reflects functional and evolutionary relationships and catalogues bacteria 'from domain to strain'. Our gene-based typing approach using online platforms such as the Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database (BIGSdb) allows the scalable organization and analysis of whole-genome sequence data.},

The entire collection was subjected to multilocus sequence typing and a subset of 286 E. coli isolates was subjected to an E. coli-specific virulence gene microarray. The most common sequence type (ST) was E. coli ST10, which was present in all human and food-animal sources, followed by ST69, ST73, ST95, ST117, and ST131. A core group of virulence genes was associated with all 10 common STs including artJ, ycfZ, csgA, csgE, fimA, fimH, gad, hlyE, ibeB, mviM, mviN, and ompA. STs 73, 92, and 95 exhibited the largest number of virulence genes, and all were exclusively identified from human infections. ST117 was found in both human and food-animal sources and shared virulence genes common in extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli lineages. Select groups of E. coli may be found in both human and food-animal reservoirs.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) and Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 emerged in the 2000s as important human pathogens, have spread extensively throughout the world, and are responsible for the rapid increase in antimicrobial resistance among E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains, respectively. E. coli ST131 causes extraintestinal infections and is often fluoroquinolone resistant and associated with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production, especially CTX-M-15. K. pneumoniae ST258 causes urinary and respiratory tract infections and is associated with carbapenemases, most often KPC-2 and KPC-3. The most prevalent lineage within ST131 is named fimH30 because it contains the H30 variant of the type 1 fimbrial adhesin gene, and recent molecular studies have demonstrated that this lineage emerged in the early 2000s and was then followed by the rapid expansion of its sublineages H30-R and H30-Rx. K. pneumoniae ST258 comprises 2 distinct lineages, namely clade I and clade II. Moreover, it seems that ST258 is a hybrid clone that was created by a large recombination event between ST11 and ST442. Epidemic plasmids with blaCTX-M and blaKPC belonging to incompatibility group F have contributed significantly to the success of these clones. E. coli ST131 and K. pneumoniae ST258 are the quintessential examples of international multidrug-resistant high-risk clones.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance can be achieved by horizontal acquisi- tion of resistance genes (carried by plasmids or transposons), by recombination of foreign DNA into the chromosome, or by mutations in different chromosomal loci (15). In studies of molecular evolutionary biology, the term mutation rate is ap- plied to estimations of the rate (per generation) of mutation per nucleotide, per locus, or, eventually, for the whole genome, and selectively favorable, unfavorable, or neutral mutations are considered. Differing with this concept, the frequency of mutation measures all the mutants present in a given popula- tion, irrespective of whether the mutation events occurred early or late during the growth of the population. In this re- spect, the frequency of mutants is a cross section of the bac- terial population at a given time and reflects not only the mutation rate but also the history of the population before selection is applied.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the occurrence of extended spectrum cephalosporinase (ESC)-producing Escherichia coli in a broiler production with no cephalosporin use and a low use of antimicrobials in general. Furthermore, it investigated whether the current consumption of aminopenicillins selects for ESC-producing E. coli and whether certain clones or plasmids spread from imported parent flocks to the meat. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ESC-producing E. coli was isolated using MacConkey broth with 1 mg/L of ceftriaxone. ESC genes were identified using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Isolates with blaCMY-2 were subtyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), phylotyping, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Selected isolates were used as donors in filter-mating experiments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and plasmid replicons were typed. Aminopenicillin use at the farm (not flock) level was obtained from VetStat, a database for mandatory registration of veterinary prescriptions in Denmark. RESULTS: ESC-producing E. coli occurred in 93{\%} (27/29) of broiler parent farms in 2011, 27{\%} (53/197) of broiler flocks in 2010, and 3.3{\%} (4/121) of Danish retail broiler meat in 2009 and 8.6{\%} (16/187) in 2010. The ESC producing E. coli contained blaCMY-2, blaSHV-2 or blaCTX-M-1. Isolates with blaCMY-2 represented 35 PFGE groups. One group dominated (39 isolates) and included isolates with indistinguishable PFGE patterns from parents, broilers, and meat. Most blaCMY-2 isolates were susceptible to non-beta-lactams, and blaCMY-2 was mostly present on horizontally transferable incI1 or incK plasmids. Phylogroup D was most common and E. coli MLST types previously found in humans were observed. Broiler farms with registered aminopenicillin use had significantly higher occurrence of ESC E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: ESC-producing E. coli from flocks of imported broiler parents spread clonally and horizontally to broiler meat (including potentially human pathogenic types) even in a country with no cephalosporin use. Use of aminopenicillins may influence the persistence of ESC-producing E. coli in the broiler production, but other factors should be investigated.},

Although most VFs were concentrated in phylogenetic group B2 or jointly in groups B2 and D, others were concentrated primarily in group D, were broadly distributed (without group-specific associations), and/or occurred only outside of group B2. Statistical correlations among VFs suggested linkage on pathogenicity-associated islands or plasmids. Isolates from humans and nonhuman primates had more VFs than did isolates from other animals. Sequence diversity was minimal within each F type-specific papA allele group but was substantial among different papA allele groups. The distribution patterns of papA variants and other VFs suggested multiple horizontal transfer events.

abstract = {Elective enrichment is an indispensable technique in bacterial physiology and genetics (van Niel, 1949). Specific biotypes are most readily isolated by the es- tablishment of cultural conditions that favor their growth or survival. It has been repeatedly questioned, however, whether a selective environment may not only select but also direct adaptive heritable changes. In accord with similar discussions in evolutionary biology (Huxley, 1942), we may denote the concepts of spontaneous mutation and natural selection in contrast to specific induction as "preadaptation" and "directed mutation", respectively. Many lines of evi- dence have been adduced in support of preadaptation in a variety of systems (Luria and Delbruick, 1943; Lea and Coulson, 1949; Burnet, 1929; Newcombe, 1949; Lewis, 1934; Kristensen, 1944; Novick and Szilard, 1950; Ryan and Schneider, 1949; Demerec, 1948; Welsch, 1950; also reviewed: Braun, 1047; Luria, 1947; Lederberg, 1948, 1949). This paper concerns an approach to this problem that makes use of a replica plating technique which facilitates the handling of large numbers of bacterial clones for classification on a variety of media.},

abstract = {Extraintestinal Escherichia coli infections are associated with extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains. A total of 114 E. coli isolates were characterized regarding their antimicrobial resistance in a prospective study of 319 broilers from 12 slaughterhouses in the Czech Republic, a European Union member, during 2008. PCR-based assays to define ExPEC-associated traits were performed in resistant strains. Consumption of antimicrobial drugs by poultry in the Czech Republic was also analyzed. Antibiotic resistance was detected in 82{\%} of isolates. Resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin was predominant. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, qnrB19 and qnrS1, were detected in 1 and 3 of 93 resistant isolates, respectively. Twenty-three percent of resistant isolates were considered as ExPEC. In total, 972 kg of flumequine, enrofloxacin, and difloxacin were used in poultry in the Czech Republic during 2008. High prevalence of broilers with ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolates was linked to consumption of quinolones in poultry. Broilers may comprise an important vehicle for community-wide dissemination of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli and ExPEC. Withdrawal of fluoroquinolones from use in chicken production should be seriously considered in the Czech Republic and the European Union as well.},

abstract = {Mutations drive evolution and were assumed to occur by chance: constantly, gradually, roughly uniformly in genomes, and without regard to environmental inputs, but this view is being revised by discoveries of molecular mechanisms of mutation in bacteria, now translated across the tree of life. These mechanisms reveal a picture of highly regulated mutagenesis, up-regulated temporally by stress responses and activated when cells/organisms are maladapted to their environmentsâwhen stressedâpotentially accelerating adaptation. Mutation is also nonrandom in genomic space, with multiple simultaneous mutations falling in local clusters, which may allow concerted evolutionâthe multiple changes needed to adapt protein functions and protein machines encoded by linked genes. Molecular mechanisms of stress-inducible mutation change ideas about evolution and suggest different ways to model and address cancer development, infectious disease, and evolution generally.},

abstract = {The background of quinolone resistance was characterized in ciprofloxacin-resistant commensal Escherichia coli selected out of 3,551 isolates from slaughtered animals in Poland between 2009 and 2012. Plasmid-mediated determinants were suspected in 6.2{\%} of the study group, ranging from 1.1{\%} in cattle to 9.7{\%} in turkeys. Polymerase chain reaction and sequencing identified up to four quinolone resistance-determining substitutions in gyrA (Ser83, Asp87) and parC (Ala56, Ser80). Plasmid-mediated mechanisms were identified as qnrS1 (or qnrS3, n=70, including six isolates with chromosomal mutations), qnrB19 (or qnrB10, n=19), and qnrB17 (n=1). All tested isolates were negative for qnrA, qnrC, qnrD, qepA, and aac(6')-Ib-cr. Still, there were several E. coli suspected for both plasmid- and chromosome-mediated resistance with unrevealed genetic background of the phenomenon. Since all tested isolates showed diverse XbaI-PFGE profiles, chromosome-encoded quinolone resistance does not result from the spread of a single resistant clone, however, it is rather due to antimicrobial pressure leading to the selection of random gyr and par mutants. It also favors the selection and spread of plasmids carrying predominant qnr genes, since the same determinants were found in Salmonella, isolated from similar sources. The identification of carrier plasmids and mitigation of their spread might be essential for sustainable quinolone usage in animal husbandry and efficient protection of human health.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in relation to human population densities. Samples from wild red foxes (n = 528) included in the Norwegian monitoring programme on antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food, feed and animals were included. All samples were divided into three different groups based on population density in the municipality where the foxes were hunted. Of the 528 samples included, 108 (20.5{\%}), 328 (62.1{\%}) and 92 (17.4{\%}) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. A single faecal swab was collected from each fox. All samples were plated out on a selective medium for Enterobacteriaceae for culturing followed by inclusion and susceptibility testing of one randomly selected Escherichia coli to assess the overall occurrence of AMR in the Gram-negative bacterial population. Furthermore, the samples were subjected to selective screening for detection of E. coli displaying resistance towards extended-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. In addition, a subset of samples (n = 387) were subjected to selective culturing to detect E. coli resistant to carbapenems and colistin, and enterococci resistant to vancomycin. Of these, 98 (25.3{\%}), 200 (51.7{\%}) and 89 (23.0{\%}) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. Overall, the occurrence of AMR in indicator E. coli from wild red foxes originating from areas with different human population densities in Norway was low to moderate (8.8{\%}). The total occurrence of AMR was significantly higher; $\chi$2 (1,N = 336) = 6.53, p = 0.01 in areas with high population density compared to areas with medium population density. Similarly, the occurrence of fluoroquinolone resistant E. coli isolated using selective detection methods was low in areas with low population density and more common in areas with medium or high population density. In conclusion, we found indications that occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in Norway is associated with human population density. Foxes living in urban areas are more likely to be exposed to AMR bacteria and resistance drivers from food waste, garbage, sewage, waste water and consumption of contaminated prey compared to foxes living in remote areas. The homerange of red fox has been shown to be limited thereby the red fox constitutes a good sentinel for monitoring antimicrobial resistance in the environment. Continuous monitoring on the occurrence of AMR in different wild species, ecological niches and geographical areas can facilitate an increased understanding of the environmental burden of AMR in the environment. Such information is needed to further assess the impact for humans, and enables implementation of possible control measures for AMR in humans, animals and the environment in a true "One Health" approach.},

abstract = {A cross-sectional study on 32 different Belgian broiler farms was performed in 2007 and 2008 to identify risk factors for ceftiofur resistance in Escherichia coli. On each farm, one E. coli colony was isolated from 30 random birds. Following susceptibility testing of 14 antimicrobials, an on-farm questionnaire was used to obtain information on risk factors. Using a multilevel logistic regression model two factors were identified at the animal level: resistance to amoxicillin and to trimethoprim-sulfonamide. On the farm level, besides antimicrobial use, seven management factors were found to be associated with the occurrence of ceftiofur resistance in E. coli from broilers: poor hygienic condition of the medicinal treatment reservoir, no acidification of drinking water, more than three feed changes during the production cycle, hatchery of origin, breed, litter material used, and treatment with amoxicillin. This study confirms that not only on-farm antimicrobial therapy, but also management- and hatchery-related factors influence the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance.},

In the animal line, a total of 256 isolates were collected from pregnant sows (10 samples and 20 isolates), 1-week-old piglets (20 samples and 40 isolates), unweaned piglets (20 samples and 38 isolates), growers (20 samples and 40 isolates), and the finishers' floor pen (6 samples and 118 isolates); from the underfloor pits and farm slurry tank environmental lines, 100 and 119 isolates, respectively, were collected. Our results showed that E. coli populations in the pig fecal microbiota and in the farm environment are highly dynamic and show high levels of diversity. These issues have been proven through DNA-based typing data (repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR [REP-PCR]) and phenotypic typing data (antimicrobial resistance profile comprising 19 antimicrobials). Clustering of the sampling groups based on their REP-PCR typing results showed that the spatial features (the line) had a stronger weight than the temporal features (sampling week) for the clustering of E. coli populations; this weight was less significant when clustering was performed based on resistotypes. Among animals, finishers harbored an E. coli population different from those of the remaining animal populations studied, considering REP-PCR fingerprints and resistotypes. This population, the most important from a public health perspective, demonstrated the lowest levels of antimicrobial resistance and integron presence.},

abstract = {The plasmid-borne quinolone resistance gene qnrA1 is prevalent in multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. A chromosomally encoded homologue in Shewanella algae, qnrA3, has been described. We isolated two qnrA3-positive strains, one of Klebsiella pneumoniae (He96) and one of Kluyvera ascorbata (Kas96), from the feces of an immunocompromised outpatient. The qnrA3 allele was identical to that of S. algae except for 5 nucleotides and differed from qnrA1 by 29 nucleotides affecting three amino acids. The analysis of the qnrA3 genetic environment showed that qnrA3 was inserted downstream from an ISCR1 element at a recombination crossover site described for other resistance genes, including qnrA1, and immediately upstream from IS26, a situation not described before. IS26 preceded an incomplete class 1 integron which contained, among other genes, aac(6')-Ib-cr, another transferable quinolone resistance gene, and the beta-lactamase gene bla(OXA-1/30). The 10-kb fragment encompassing qnrA3 was compared to previously described qnrA1-containing plasmids and multidrug-resistant plasmids; it shares identical sequences with pC15a, pHSH2, pQR1, pQKp311H, and pSAL-1 but with rearrangements, deletions, and mutations. Conjugal transfer of qnrA3 was highly efficient (10(-2)) from K. pneumoniae He96 or K. ascorbata Kas96 to Escherichia coli J53 but less so (10(-5)) from either donor to a clinical strain of Enterobacter cloacae. This first description of a plasmid-borne copy and of the in vitro transfer of qnrA3 is taken to illustrate its likely in vivo transfer from S. algae to the Enterobacteriaceae.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To discern the relevance of ST648 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli as a putative new group of multiresistant and extraintestinal pathogenic strains in animals, its frequency, ESBL types, antimicrobial resistance patterns and virulence gene (VG) profiles should be determined and compared with ST131 strains from the same collection of strains. METHODS: ESBL-producing E. coli isolates (n = 1152), consecutively sampled from predominantly dogs, cats and horses between 2008 and 2011, were assigned to a phylogenetic group by PCR. Partial multilocus sequence typing was performed for group D and B2 strains and strains presumed to be D-ST648 and B2-ST131 were fully typed. ESBL genes and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC)-like VGs were characterized by PCR and sequence analysis and antimicrobial resistance was determined by broth dilution. Clonal analysis was done by PFGE. RESULTS: Forty (3.5{\%}) ESBL-producing E. coli were determined as D-ST648, whereas B2-ST131 isolates occurred less frequently (2.8{\%}). Although the predominant ESBL type in both groups was CTX-M-15 (72.5{\%} versus 46.9{\%}), ST648 strains from companion animals and horses displayed a lower variety of ESBL types (CTX-M-1, -3, -14, -15 and -61 versus CTX-M-1,-2,-14,-15,-27 and -55 and SHV-12). In contrast to ST131 strains, a higher proportion of ST648 strains showed resistance to most non-beta-lactam antibiotics. Overall, VGs were less abundant in ST648 strains, although some strains had VG profiles comparable to those of ST131 strains. ExPEC-associated serotype O1:H6 was predominant (46.8{\%}) among the ST648 strains. Some PFGE clusters comprised ST648 isolates from pets, horses and wild birds and humans included from previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that certain subgroups of E. coli D-ST648-CTX-M may represent a novel genotype that combines multiresistance, extraintestinal virulence and zoonotic potential.},

abstract = {Heat as a stressor of poultry has been studied extensively for many decades; it affects poultry production on a worldwide basis and has significant impact on well-being and production. More recently, the involvement of heat stress in inducing oxidative stress has received much interest. Oxidative stress is defined as the presence of reactive species in excess of the available antioxidant capacity of animal cells. Reactive species can modify several biologically cellular macromolecules and can interfere with cell signaling pathways. Furthermore, during the last decade, there has been an ever-increasing interest in the use of a wide array of natural feed-delivered phytochemicals that have potential antioxidant properties for poultry. In light of this, the current review aims to (1) summarize the mechanisms through which heat stress triggers excessive superoxide radical production in the mitochondrion and progresses into oxidative stress, (2) illustrate that this pathophysiology is dependent on the intensity and duration of heat stress, (3) present different nutritional strategies for mitigation of mitochondrial dysfunction, with particular focus on antioxidant phytochemicals. Oxidative stress that occurs with heat exposure can be manifest in all parts of the body; however, mitochondrial dysfunction underlies oxidative stress. In the initial phase of acute heat stress, mitochondrial substrate oxidation and electron transport chain activity are increased resulting in excessive superoxide production. During the later stage of acute heat stress, down-regulation of avian uncoupling protein worsens the oxidative stress situation causing mitochondrial dysfunction and tissue damage. Typically, antioxidant enzyme activities are upregulated. Chronic heat stress, however, leads to downsizing of mitochondrial metabolic oxidative capacity, up-regulation of avian uncoupling protein, a clear alteration in the pattern of antioxidant enzyme activities, and depletion of antioxidant reserves. Some phytochemicals, such as various types of flavonoids and related compounds, were shown to be beneficial in chronic heat-stressed poultry, but were less or not effective in non-heat-stressed counterparts. This supports the contention that antioxidant phytochemicals have potential under challenging conditions. Though substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the association between heat stress and oxidative stress, the means by which phytochemicals can alleviate oxidative stress have been sparsely explored.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli O103, harbored in the hindgut and shed in the feces of cattle, can be enterohemorrhagic (EHEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), or putative non-pathotype. The genetic diversity particularly that of virulence gene profiles within O103 serogroup is likely to be broad, considering the wide range in severity of illness. However, virulence descriptions of the E. coli O103 strains isolated from cattle feces have been primarily limited to major genes, such as Shiga toxin and intimin genes. Less is known about the frequency at which other virulence genes exist or about genes associated with the mobile genetic elements of E. coli O103 pathotypes. Our objective was to utilize whole genome sequencing (WGS) to identify and compare major and putative virulence genes of EHEC O103 (positive for Shiga toxin gene, stx1, and intimin gene, eae; n = 43), EPEC O103 (negative for stx1 and positive for eae; n = 13) and putative non-pathotype O103 strains (negative for stx and eae; n = 13) isolated from cattle feces. Six strains of EHEC O103 from human clinical cases were also included. All bovine EHEC strains (43/43) and a majority of EPEC (12/13) and putative non-pathotype strains (12/13) were O103:H2 serotype. Both bovine and human EHEC strains had significantly larger average genome sizes (P {\textless} 0.0001) and were positive for a higher number of adherence and toxin-based virulence genes and genes on mobile elements (prophages, transposable elements, and plasmids) than EPEC or putative non-pathotype strains. The genome size of the three pathotypes positively correlated (R 2 = 0.7) with the number of genes carried on mobile genetic elements. Bovine strains clustered phylogeneti-cally by pathotypes, which differed in several key virulence genes. The diversity of E. coli O103 pathotypes shed in cattle feces is likely reflective of the acquisition or loss of virulence genes carried on mobile genetic elements.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a natural feature of diverse microbial ecosystems. Although recent studies of the antibiotic resistome have highlighted barriers to the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes between habitats, the rapid global spread of genes that confer resistance to carbapenem, colistin and quinolone antibiotics illustrates the dire clinical and societal consequences of such events. Over time, the study of antibiotic resistance has grown from focusing on single pathogenic organisms in axenic culture to studying antibiotic resistance in pathogenic, commensal and environmental bacteria at the level of microbial communities. As the study of antibiotic resistance advances, it is important to incorporate this comprehensive approach to better inform global antibiotic resistance surveillance and antibiotic development. It is increasingly becoming apparent that although not all resistance genes are likely to geographically and phylogenetically disseminate, the threat presented by those that are is serious and warrants an interdisciplinary research focus. In this Review, we highlight seminal work in the resistome field, discuss recent advances in the studies of resistomes, and propose a resistome paradigm that can pave the way for the improved proactive identification and mitigation of emerging antibiotic resistance threats.},

abstract = {Acquired carbapenemases pose one of the most pressing public health threats relating to antibiotic resistance. In most countries, the number of carbapenemase-producing bacteria from human clinical specimens is rising, and the epidemiological status of these multiresistant bacteria is progressively worsening. Furthermore, there is a growing number of reports of carbapenemases found either in bacteria isolated from non-human sources or in Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, a zoonotic species. However, carbapenemases are not yet systematically sought in bacteria from non-human sources, reports of them are largely observational, and there is limited investigation of carbapenemase-positive bacteria in animals and possible links with people who may have acted as potential sources. Active surveillance and monitoring for carbapenem-resistant bacteria in the food chain and other non-human sources is urgently needed, with an enhanced and rigorous follow-up of all positive results. The carbapenems are currently our last good defence against multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria. Our ability to limit the rise and spread of carbapenemase producers, which occur only at basal levels in many countries at present, should serve as a key performance indicator for the success or failure of the efforts that have been called for by international organizations and governments to reduce the impact of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {Multidrug resistance (MDR) refers to the capability of bacterial pathogens to withstand lethal doses of structurally diverse drugs which are capable of eradicating non-resistant strains. MDR has been identified as a major threat to the public health of human being by the World Health Organization (WHO). Among the four general mechanisms that cause antibiotic resistance including target alteration, drug inactivation, decreased permeability and increased efflux, drug extrusion by the multidrug efflux pumps serves as an important mechanism of MDR. Efflux pumps not only can expel a broad range of antibiotics owing to their poly-substrate specificity, but also drive the acquisition of additional resistance mechanisms by lowering intracellular antibiotic concentration and promoting mutation accumulation. Over-expression of multidrug efflux pumps have been increasingly found to be associated with clinically relevant drug resistance. On the other hand, accumulating evidence has suggested that efflux pumps also have physiological functions in bacteria and their expression is subject tight regulation in response to various of environmental and physiological signals. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of drug extrusion, and regulation and physiological functions of efflux pumps is essential for the development of anti-resistance interventions. In this review, we summarize the development of these research areas in the recent decades and present the pharmacological exploitation of efflux pump inhibitors as a promising anti-drug resistance intervention.},

abstract = {The conjugative plasmid pOLA52, which confers resistance to olaquindox and other antimicrobial agents through a multidrug efflux pump, was investigated for its ability to promote biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. Screening of a transposon-mutagenized pOLA52 clone library revealed several biofilm-deficient mutants, which all mapped within a putative operon with high homology to the mrkABCDF operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae, where these genes are responsible for type 3 fimbriae expression, attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. Biofilm formation in microtitre plates and in urinary catheters of clones containing pOLA52 with a disrupted putative mrk operon was reduced by more than 100-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to mutants with an intact mrk operon. The conjugative transfer rate of pOLA52 was also significantly lower when the mrk operon was disrupted. Through reverse transcriptase analysis, it was demonstrated that the genes contained in the putative mrk operon were linked and likely to be expressed as a single operon. Immunoblotting with type 3 fimbriae (MrkA)-specific antibodies further verified expression of type 3 fimbriae. When transferred to other, potentially pathogenic, members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella Typhimurium, Kluyvera sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes, pOLA52 facilitated increased biofilm formation. pOLA52 is believed to represent the first example of a conjugative plasmid encoding type 3 fimbriae, resulting in enhanced conjugation frequencies and biofilm formation of the plasmid-harbouring strain.},

abstract = {Motivation: The computation of large phylogenetic trees with statistical models such as maximum likelihood or bayesian inference is computationally extremely intensive. It has repeatedly been demonstrated that these models are able to recover the true tree or a tree which is topologically closer to the true tree more frequently than less elaborate methods such as parsimony or neighbor joining. Due to the combinatorial and computational complexity the size of trees which can be com-puted on a Biologist's PC workstation within reasonable time is limited to trees containing approximately 100 taxa. Results: In this paper we present the latest release of our program RAxML-III for rapid maximum likelihood-based infer-ence of large evolutionary trees which allows for computation of 1.000-taxon trees in less than 24 hours on a single PC processor. We compare RAxML-III to the currently fastest implementations for maximum likelihood and bayesian infer-ence: PHYML and MrBayes. Whereas RAxML-III performs worse than PHYML and MrBayes on synthetic data it clearly outperforms both programs on all real data alignments used in terms of speed and final likelihood values.

abstract = {Antibiotics have always been considered one of the wonder discoveries of the 20th century. This is true, but the real wonder is the rise of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, communities, and the environment concomitant with their use. The extraordinary genetic capacities of microbes have benefitted from man's overuse of antibiotics to exploit every source of resistance genes and every means of horizontal gene transmission to develop multiple mechanisms of resistance for each and every antibiotic introduced into practice clinically, agriculturally, or otherwise. This review presents the salient aspects of antibiotic resistance development over the past half-century, with the oft-restated conclusion that it is time to act. To achieve complete restitution of therapeutic applications of antibiotics, there is a need for more information on the role of environmental microbiomes in the rise of antibiotic resistance. In particular, creative approaches to the discovery of novel antibiotics and their expedited and controlled introduction to therapy are obligatory.},

abstract = {In this review, our current understanding of the species Escherichia coli and its persistence in the open environment is examined. E. coli consists of six different subgroups, which are separable by genomic analyses. Strains within each subgroup occupy various ecological niches, and can be broadly characterized by either commensalistic or different pathogenic behaviour. In relevant cases, genomic islands can be pinpointed that underpin the behaviour. Thus, genomic islands of, on the one hand, broad environmental significance, and, on the other hand, virulence, are highlighted in the context of E. coli survival in its niches. A focus is further placed on experimental studies on the survival of the different types of E. coli in soil, manure and water. Overall, the data suggest that E. coli can persist, for varying periods of time, in such terrestrial and aquatic habitats. In particular, the considerable persistence of the pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 is of importance, as its acid tolerance may be expected to confer a fitness asset in the more acidic environments. In this context, the extent to which E. coli interacts with its human/animal host and the organism's survivability in natural environments are compared. In addition, the effect of the diversity and community structure of the indigenous microbiota on the fate of invading E. coli populations in the open environment is discussed. Such a relationship is of importance to our knowledge of both public and environmental health.},

abstract = {Fluoroquinolone (FQ)-resistant Salmonella spp. were listed by the WHO in 2017 as priority pathogens for which new antibiotics were urgently needed. The overall global burden of Salmonella infections is high, but differs per region. Whereas typhoid fever is most prevalent in South and SouthEast Asia, non-typhoidal salmonellosis is prevalent across the globe and associated with a mild gastroenteritis. By contrast, invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella cause bloodstream infections associated with high mortality, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Most Salmonella strains from clinical sources are resistant to first-line antibiotics, with FQs now being the antibiotic of choice for treatment of invasive Salmonella infections. However, FQ resistance is increasingly being reported in Salmonella, and multiple molecular mechanisms are already described. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming more frequently used to analyse bacterial genomes for antibiotic-resistance markers, and to understand the phylogeny of bacteria in relation to their antibiotic-resistance profiles. This mini-review provides an overview of FQ resistance in Salmonella, guided by WGS studies that demonstrate that WGS is a valuable tool for global surveillance.},

abstract = {Fecal Klebsiella isolates from neonates in 22 Swedish special care units were examined by a PCR we developed for detection of the SHV-1 beta-lactamase gene. All 105 K. pneumoniae isolates and all 11 K. pneumoniae reference strains (including the K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, ozaenae, and rhinoscleromatis type strains) tested were positive, whereas all 67 K. oxytoca isolates and the K. oxytoca, K. planticola, and K. terrigena type strains tested were negative. Resistance to beta-lactams in K. pneumoniae was not transferable by conjugation, and the beta-lactamase gene was never found on a plasmid. Southern blot analysis showed that the gene had a defined chromosomal location. Isoelectric focusing and sequencing of 231-bp PCR amplicons from different isolates revealed many variants of the enzyme, with the two main groups being SHV-1 like (pI 7.6; 68 isolates) and LEN-1 like (pI 7.1; 14 isolates). Clavulanic acid markedly reduced the MICs of ampicillin for all the K. pneumoniae isolates tested. This fact, MIC profiles (penicillin rather than cephalosporin resistance), pIs, and sequence data showed that the chromosomal beta-lactamase of K. pneumoniae is a class A, group 2 enzyme distinct from the chromosomal AmpC enzymes found in several other gram-negative bacteria and from the chromosomal beta-lactamase K1 of K. oxytoca. We propose that the chromosomal beta-lactamase of K. pneumoniae be designated K2 and suggest that an allelic pI 7.6 variant of this enzyme is the ancestor of the SHV family of plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are emerging contaminants posing a potential worldwide human health risk. Intensive animal husbandry is believed to be a major contributor to the increased environmental burden of ARGs. Despite the volume of antibiotics used in China, little information is available regarding the corresponding ARGs associated with animal farms. We assessed type and concentrations of ARGs at three stages of manure processing to land disposal at three large-scale (10,000 animals per year) commercial swine farms in China. In-feed or therapeutic antibiotics used on these farms include all major classes of antibiotics except vancomycins. High-capacity quantitative PCR arrays detected 149 unique resistance genes among all of the farm samples, the top 63 ARGs being enriched 192-fold (median) up to 28,000-fold (maximum) compared with their respective antibiotic-free manure or soil controls. Antibiotics and heavy metals used as feed supplements were elevated in the manures, suggesting the potential for coselection of resistance traits. The potential for horizontal transfer of ARGs because of transposon-specific ARGs is implicated by the enrichment of transposases--the top six alleles being enriched 189-fold (median) up to 90,000-fold in manure--as well as the high correlation (r(2) = 0.96) between ARG and transposase abundance. In addition, abundance of ARGs correlated directly with antibiotic and metal concentrations, indicating their importance in selection of resistance genes. Diverse, abundant, and potentially mobile ARGs in farm samples suggest that unmonitored use of antibiotics and metals is causing the emergence and release of ARGs to the environment.},

abstract = {CMY-2 is the most common plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase in Escherichia coli isolates of human and animal origin. The aim of this study was to elucidate the epidemiology of CMY-2-producing E. coli in Denmark. Strain and plasmid relatedness was studied in 93 CMY-2-producing clinical and commensal E. coli isolates collected in 2006-2012 from humans, retail poultry meat, broilers and dogs. MLST, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and conjugation were performed in conjunction with plasmid replicon typing, pMLST, RFLP, and sequencing of selected blaCMY-2-harboring plasmids. MLST revealed high strain diversity with few E. coli lineages occurring in multiple host species and sample types. blaCMY-2 was detected on plasmids in 83 (89{\%}) isolates. Most (75{\%}) of these plasmids were conjugative and did not (96{\%}) co-transfer resistance to other antimicrobials than cephalosporins. The main replicon types identified were IncI1-Igamma (55{\%}) and IncK (39{\%}). Isolates from different host species mainly carried distinct plasmid subtypes. Seven of the 18 human isolates harbored IncI1-Igamma/ST2, IncI1-Igamma/ST12 or IncK plasmids highly similar to those found among animal isolates, even though highly related human and animal plasmids differed by non-synonymous SNPs or insertion sequence elements. This study clearly demonstrates that the epidemiology of CMY-2 can only be understood by thorough plasmid characterization. To date the spread of this beta-lactam resistance determinant in Denmark is mainly associated with IncK and IncI1-Igamma plasmids that are generally distributed according to host-specific patterns. These baseline data will be useful to assess the consequences of the increasing human exposure to CMY-2-producing E. coli via animal sources. IMPORTANCE: CMY-2 is the most common plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase in Escherichia coli This beta-lactamase is poorly inhibited by clavulanic acid and confers resistance to cephamycins, third-generation cephalosporins and aztreonam. Further, resistance to carbapenems has been reported in E. coli as a result of production of plasmid-encoded CMY-2 beta-lactamase in combination with decreased outer membrane permeability. The gene encoding CMY-2 generally resides on transferable plasmids belonging to different incompatibility groups. The prevalence of CMY-2-mediated cephalosporin resistance in E. coli varies significantly depending on geographical region and host. This study demonstrates that the epidemiology of CMY-2 can only be understood by thorough plasmid characterization. To date the spread of this beta-lactam resistance determinant in Denmark is mainly associated with IncK and IncI1-Igamma plasmids that are generally distributed according to host-specific patterns. These data will be useful to assess the consequences of the increasing human exposure to CMY-2-producing E. coli via animal sources.},

abstract = {Third-generation cephalosporins are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that are often used for the treatment of human infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, especially Escherichia coli. Worryingly, the incidence of human infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli is increasing worldwide. Recent studies have suggested that these E. coli strains, and their antibiotic resistance genes, can spread from food-producing animals, via the food-chain, to humans. However, these studies used traditional typing methods, which may not have provided sufficient resolution to reliably assess the relatedness of these strains. We therefore used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to study the relatedness of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli from humans, chicken meat, poultry and pigs. One strain collection included pairs of human and poultry-associated strains that had previously been considered to be identical based on Multi-Locus Sequence Typing, plasmid typing and antibiotic resistance gene sequencing. The second collection included isolates from farmers and their pigs. WGS analysis revealed considerable heterogeneity between human and poultry-associated isolates. The most closely related pairs of strains from both sources carried 1263 Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) per Mbp core genome. In contrast, epidemiologically linked strains from humans and pigs differed by only 1.8 SNPs per Mbp core genome. WGS-based plasmid reconstructions revealed three distinct plasmid lineages (IncI1- and IncK-type) that carried cephalosporin resistance genes of the Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-types. The plasmid backbones within each lineage were virtually identical and were shared by genetically unrelated human and animal isolates. Plasmid reconstructions from short-read sequencing data were validated by long-read DNA sequencing for two strains. Our findings failed to demonstrate evidence for recent clonal transmission of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli strains from poultry to humans, as has been suggested based on traditional, low-resolution typing methods. Instead, our data suggest that cephalosporin resistance genes are mainly disseminated in animals and humans via distinct plasmids.},

abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing has been skewed toward bacterial pathogens as a consequence of the prioritization of medical and veterinary diseases. However, it is becoming clear that in order to accurately measure genetic variation within and between pathogenic groups, multiple isolates, as well as commensal species, must be sequenced. This study examined the pangenomic content of Escherichia coli. Six distinct E. coli pathovars can be distinguished using molecular or phenotypic markers, but only two of the six pathovars have been subjected to any genome sequencing previously. Thus, this report provides a seminal description of the genomic contents and unique features of three unsequenced pathovars, enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, and enteroaggregative E. coli. We also determined the first genome sequence of a human commensal E. coli isolate, E. coli HS, which will undoubtedly provide a new baseline from which workers can examine the evolution of pathogenic E. coli. Comparison of 17 E. coli genomes, 8 of which are new, resulted in identification of approximately 2,200 genes conserved in all isolates. We were also able to identify genes that were isolate and pathovar specific. Fewer pathovar-specific genes were identified than anticipated, suggesting that each isolate may have independently developed virulence capabilities. Pangenome calculations indicate that E. coli genomic diversity represents an open pangenome model containing a reservoir of more than 13,000 genes, many of which may be uncharacterized but important virulence factors. This comparative study of the species E. coli, while descriptive, should provide the basis for future functional work on this important group of pathogens.},

abstract = {Multidrug efflux pumps contribute to the resistance of Escherichia coli to many antibiotics and biocides. Here, we report that the AraC-family regulator GadX increases multidrug resistance in E. coli through activation of the MdtEF efflux pump. Screening of random fragments of genomic DNA for ability to increase beta-lactam resistance led to the isolation of a plasmid containing gadX, which codes for the regulator of acid resistance. When overexpressed, gadX significantly increased the resistance of the E. coli strain to oxacillin, cloxacillin, nafcillin, erythromycin, rhodamine 6G, and sodium dodecyl sulfate. The increase in drug resistance caused by gadX overexpression was completely suppressed by deleting the multifunctional outer membrane channel gene tolC. TolC interacts with different drug efflux pumps. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that GadX activated the expression of mdtEF but none of the other drug efflux pumps in E. coli. Deletion of mdtEF completely suppressed GadX-mediated multidrug resistance. Our results indicate that the GadX regulator, in addition to its role in acid resistance, increases multidrug resistance in E. coli by activating the MdtEF multidrug efflux pump.},

The collection included 59 high-level CIP-resistant isolates (MIC {\textgreater}or= 4) from human (n=51) and pig origin (n=8) and 65 low-level CIP-resistant isolates (MIC {\textgreater}or= 0.125) from human (n=34) and pig origin (n=31). Resistance by target modification was screened by PCR amplification and sequencing of the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE. QRDR mutations occurred in all except two isolates (98{\%}). All high-level CIP-resistant E. coli had one or two mutations in gyrA in combination with mutations in parC or parE. Mutations in parC and parE were only found in combination with gyrA mutations, and no mutations were observed in gyrB. Efflux pump mechanisms were detected in 10 human (11.8{\%}) and 29 porcine (74.4{\%}) isolates by an efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) agar dilution assay. The aac(6')-Ib-cr gene mediating resistance by enzymatic modification was found in 12 high-level CIP-resistant human isolates. The qnrA and qnrS genes conferring quinolone resistance by target protection were detected in two human low-level CIP-resistant isolates that did not display NAL resistance. As expected, target mutation in QRDRs was the most prevalent mechanism of quinolone resistance. This mechanism was complemented by efflux mechanisms in most porcine isolates. Transferable resistance by target protection or enzymatic modification was less common (10{\%}) and restricted to human isolates.},

Multidrug pumps, particularly those represented by the clinically relevant AcrAB-TolC and Mex pumps of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) superfamily, not only mediate intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance (MDR) but also are involved in other functions, including the bacterial stress response and pathogenicity. Additionally, efflux pumps interact synergistically with other resistance mechanisms (e.g., with the outer membrane permeability barrier) to increase resistance levels. Since the discovery of RND pumps in the early 1990s, remarkable scientific and technological advances have allowed for an in-depth understanding of the structural and biochemical basis, substrate profiles, molecular regulation, and inhibition of MDR pumps. However, the development of clinically useful efflux pump inhibitors and/or new antibiotics that can bypass pump effects continues to be a challenge. Plasmid-borne efflux pump genes (including those for RND pumps) have increasingly been identified. This article highlights the recent progress obtained for organisms of clinical significance, together with methodological considerations for the characterization of MDR pumps.},

Previous reports suggest that the addition of thiourea in the gel buffer can improved the typeability for some species. In the present study, 66 Gram-negative strains (seven species) known to be affected by DNA degradation and four control strains were evaluated by PFGE with and without the addition of 50 microg/M of thiourea to the buffer used in the electrophoresis. Macrorestriction patterns were obtained for all K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, and Salmonella spp., for 95.4{\%} of E. coli, and for 50{\%} of E. cloacae strains from the gels performed in the buffer with throurea. However, typeability was not improved for Acinetobacter spp. The range of non-typeable species for which thiourea can limit the problem of DNA degradation is considerably wider than described in previous publications.},

abstract = {Drug resistance in bacteria is increasing and the pace at which new antibiotics are being produced is slowing. It is now almost commonplace to hear about methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), multi-drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDRTB) strains and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria. So-called new and emerging pathogens add to the gravity of the situation. Reduced susceptibility to biocides is also apparently increasing, but is more likely to be low level in nature and to concentrations well below those used in hospital, domestic an industrial practice. A particular problem, however, is found with bacteria and other micro-organisms present in biofilms, where a variety of factors can contribute to greater insusceptibility compared with cells in planktonic culture. Also of potential concern is the possibility that widespread usage of biocides is responsible for the selection and maintenance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The basic mechanisms of action of, and bacterial resistance to, antibiotics are generally well documented, although data continue to accumulate about the nature and importance of efflux systems. In contrast, the modes of action of most biocides are poorly understood and consequently, detailed evaluation of bacterial resistance mechanisms is often disappointing. During this Symposium, the mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and biocides are discussed at length. It is hoped that this knowledge will be used to develop newer, more effective drugs and biocides that can be better and perhaps, on occasion, more logically used to combat the increasing problem of bacterial resistance.},

In the accompanying report, we found that ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and norfloxacin MICs for fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli clinical isolates were very high and widely varied (L. Becnel Boyd, M. J. Maynard, S. K. Morgan-Linnell, L. B. Horton, R. Sucgang, R. J. Hamill, J. Rojo Jimenez, J. Versalovic, D. Steffen, and L. Zechiedrich, Antimicrob.

Here, we sequenced gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE; screened for aac(6')-Ib-cr and qnrA; and quantified AcrA levels in E. coli isolates for which patient sex, age, location, and site of infection were known. We found that (i) all fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates had gyrA mutations; (ii) approximately 85{\%} of gyrA mutants also had parC mutations; (iii) the ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin MICs for isolates harboring aac(6')-Ib-cr ( approximately 23{\%}) were significantly higher, but the gatifloxacin and levofloxacin MICs were not; (iv) no isolate had qnrA; and (v) approximately 33{\%} of the fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates had increased AcrA levels. Increased AcrA correlated with nonsusceptibility to the fluoroquinolones but did not correlate with nonsusceptibility to any other antimicrobial agents reported from hospital antibiograms. Known mechanisms accounted for the fluoroquinolone MICs of 50 to 70{\%} of the isolates; the remaining included isolates for which the MICs were up to 1,500-fold higher than expected. Thus, additional, unknown fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms must be present in some clinical isolates.},

abstract = {The intensive use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, associated with mechanisms of bacterial genetic transfer, caused a selective pressure that contributed to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance in different bacteria groups and throughout different ecosystems. Iberian wolf, due to his predatory and wild nature, may serve as an important indicator of environmental contamination with antimicrobial resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to characterize the diversity of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli isolates within the fecal microbiota of Iberian wolf. Additionally, the identification of other associated resistance genes, phylogenetic groups, and the detection of virulence determinants were also focused on in this study. From 2008 to 2009, 237 fecal samples from Iberian wolf were collected in Portugal. E. coli isolates with TEM-52, SHV-12, CTX-M-1, and CTX-M-14-type ESBLs were detected in 13 of these samples (5.5{\%}). This study reveals the presence of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates, in a wild ecosystem, which could be disseminated through the environment. Moreover, the presence of resistant genes in integrons and the existence of virulence determinants were shown. The association between antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants should be monitored, as it constitutes a serious public health problem.},

abstract = {Background: The number of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive (+) Escherichia coli is increasing worldwide. In contrast with many other multidrug-resistant bacteria, it is suspected that they predominantly spread within the community. The objective of this study was to assess factors associated with community-acquired colonization of ESBL (+) E. coli. Methods: We performed a matched case-control study at the Charite University Hospital Berlin between May 2011 and January 2012. Cases were defined as patients colonized with community-acquired ESBL (+) E. coli identified {\textless}72 h after hospital admission. Controls were patients that carried no ESBL-positive bacteria but an ESBL-negative E. coli identified {\textless}72 h after hospital admission. Two controls per case were chosen from potential controls according to admission date. Case and control patients completed a questionnaire assessing nutritional habits, travel habits, household situation and language most commonly spoken at home (mother tongue). An additional rectal swab was obtained together with the questionnaire to verify colonization status. Genotypes of ESBL (+) E. coli strains were determined by PCR and sequencing. Risk factors associated with ESBL (+) E. coli colonization were analyzed by a multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis. Results: We analyzed 85 cases and 170 controls, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, speaking an Asian language most commonly at home (OR = 13.4, CI 95{\%} 3.3-53.8; p{\textless}0.001) and frequently eating pork ({\textgreater}= 3 meals per week) showed to be independently associated with ESBL colonization (OR = 3.5, CI 95{\%} 1.8-6.6; p{\textless}0.001). The most common ESBL genotypes were CTX-M-1 with 44{\%} (n = 37), CTX-M-15 with 28{\%} (n = 24) and CTX-M-14 with 13{\%} (n = 11). Conclusion: An Asian mother tongue and frequently consuming certain types of meat like pork can be independently associated with the colonization of ESBL-positive bacteria. We found neither frequent consumption of poultry nor previous use of antibiotics to be associated with ESBL colonization.},

We review what is currently known about MccB17-gyrase interactions and summarise approaches to understanding its mode of action that involve modification of the toxin. We describe experiments in which treatment of the toxin at high pH leads to the deamidation of two asparagine residues to aspartates. The modified toxin was found to be inactive in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that the Asn residues are essential for activity. Following on from these studies we have used molecular modelling to suggest a 3D structure for microcin B17.

abstract = {Escherichia coli was isolated from more than 2300 non-domesticated vertebrate hosts living in Australia. E. coli was most prevalent in mammals, less prevalent in birds and uncommon in fish, frogs and reptiles. Mammals were unlikely to harbour E. coli if they lived in regions with a desert climate and less likely to have E. coli if they lived in the tropics than if they lived in semi-arid or temperate regions. In mammals, the likelihood of isolating E. coli from an individual depended on the diet of the host and E. coli was less prevalent in carnivores than in herbivores or omnivores. In both birds and mammals, the probability of isolating E. coli increased with the body mass of the host. Hosts living in close proximity to human habitation were more likely to harbour E. coli than hosts living away from people. The relative abundance of E. coli groups A, B1, B2 and D strains in mammals depended on climate, host diet and body mass. Group A strains were uncommon, but were isolated from both ectothermic and endothermic vertebrates. Group B1 strains could also be isolated from any vertebrate group, but were predominant in ectothermic vertebrates, birds and carnivorous mammals. Group B2 strains were unlikely to be isolated from ectotherms and were most abundant in omnivorous and herbivorous mammals. Group D strains were rare in ectotherms and uncommon in endotherms, but were equally abundant in birds and mammals. The results of this study suggest that, at the species level, the ecological niche of E. coli is mammals with hindgut modifications to enable microbial fermentation, or in the absence of a modified hindgut, E. coli can only establish a population in 'large-bodied' hosts. The non-random distribution of E. coli genotypes among the different host groups indicates that strains of the four E. coli groups may differ in their ecological niches and life-history characteristics.},

Most bacteria have evolved a coordinated response to DNA damage. In Escherichia coli, this inducible system is termed the SOS response. The SOS global regulatory network consists of multiple factors promoting the integrity of DNA as well as errorâprone factors allowing for survival and continuous replication upon extensive DNA damage at the cost of elevated mutagenesis. Due to its mutagenic potential, the SOS response is subject to elaborate regulatory control involving not only transcriptional derepression, but also postâtranslational activation and inhibition. This review summarizes current knowledge about the molecular mechanism of the SOS response induction and progression and its consequences for genome stability. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) represent a major threat among resistant bacterial isolates. The first types described were derivatives of the TEM-1, TEM-2 and SHV-1 enzymes during the 1980s in Europe, mainly in Klebsiella pneumoniae associated with nosocomial outbreaks. Nowadays, they are mostly found among Escherichia coli isolates in community-acquired infections, with an increasing occurrence of CTX-M enzymes. The prevalence of ESBLs in Europe is higher than in the USA but lower than in Asia and South America. However, important differences among European countries have been observed. Spread of mobile genetic elements, mainly epidemic plasmids, and the dispersion of specific clones have been responsible for the increase in ESBL-producing isolates, such as those with TEM-4, TEM-24, TEM-52, SHV-12, CTX-M-9, CTX-M-14, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-15 and CTX-M-32 enzymes.},

An open reading frame of 2625 nucleotides coding for a protein of 97,000 Mr is located. The peptide weight of the subunit predicted from this open reading frame is in close agreement with previously published estimates of that of the A subunit. There is a "TATAAT" promoter motif located 44 bases upstream from the first "ATG" of the open reading frame. The amino acid sequence derived from the nucleotide sequence is about 50{\%} homologous with that derived from the Bacillus subtilis gyrA gene sequence, with several regions showing greater than 90{\%} homology. ?? 1987.},

abstract = {Microbes have evolved over 3.5 billion years and are arguably the most adaptable organisms on earth. Restricted genetically by their inability to reproduce sexually, bacteria have acquired several additional mechanisms by which to exchange genetic material horizontally. Such mechanisms have allowed bacteria to inhabit some of the most inhospitable environments on earth. It is thus hardly surprising that when faced with a barrage of inimical chemicals (antibiotics) they have responded with an equal and opposite force. This article compares and contrasts the evolution of antimicrobial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics over the last 70 years in two bacterial species, namely Staphylococcus aureus, a highly evolved human pathogen, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of qnrA1, qnrB1 and qnrS1 on the in vivo efficacies of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin in an experimental model of pneumonia caused by Escherichia coli. METHODS: Two isogenic groups of E. coli transformants, based on two ATCC 25922 strains, with or without the GyrA mutation Ser83Leu, and carrying qnrA1, qnrB1 or qnrS1, were used in an experimental pneumonia model. The efficacies of ciprofloxacin (40 mg/kg/day) and levofloxacin (50 and 150 mg/kg/day) were evaluated. RESULTS: For the pneumonia caused by the parental strains lacking qnr genes, both fluoroquinolones significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) reduced the bacterial lung concentration by {\textgreater}7 log10 cfu/g against E. coli ATCC/pBK and between 5.09 and 6.34 log10 cfu/g against E. coli ATCC-S83L/pBK. The presence of any qnr genes in the strains of both isogenic groups diminished the reduction of bacterial lung concentration with any therapy (P {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, all therapeutic schemes reduced the percentage of positive blood cultures in both isogenic groups (P {\textless} 0.05). Finally, the survival results suggest a higher mortality with the strains expressing qnr genes. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of qnrA1, qnrB1 and qnrS1 in E. coli reduced the efficacy of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin in a murine pneumonia model.},

In Quebec, changes of ceftiofur resistance in chicken Salmonella Heidelberg and Escherichia coli isolates appear related to changing levels of ceftiofur use in hatcheries during the study period, from highest to lowest levels before and after a voluntary withdrawal, to increasing levels after reintroduction of use (62{\%} to 7{\%} to 20{\%}, and 34{\%} to 6{\%} to 19{\%}, respectively). These events provide evidence that ceftiofur use in chickens results in extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance in bacteria from chicken and humans. To ensure the continued effectiveness of extended-spectrum cephalosporins for treating serious infections in humans, multidisciplinary efforts are needed to scrutinize and, where appropriate, limit use of ceftiofur in chicken production in Canada.},

@article{Christensen2001,
abstract = {The stringent response is defined as the physiological changes elicited by amino acid starvation. Many of these changes depend on the regulatory nucleotide ppGpp (guanosine tetraphosphate) synthesized by RelA (ppGpp synthetase I), the relA-encoded protein. The second rel locus of Escherichia coli is called relBE and encodes RelE cytotoxin and RelB antitoxin. RelB counteracts the toxic effect of RelE. In addition, RelB is an autorepressor of relBE transcription. Here we reveal a ppGpp-independent mechanism that reduces the level of translation during amino acid starvation. Artificial overexpression of RelE severely inhibited translation. During amino acid starvation, the presence of relBE caused a significant reduction in the poststarvation level of translation. Concomitantly, relBE transcription was rapidly and strongly induced. Induction of transcription occurred independently of relA and spoT (encoding ppGpp synthetase II), but instead depended on Lon protease. Consistently, Lon was required for degradation of RelB. Replacement of the relBE promoter with a LacI-regulated promoter indicated that strong and ongoing transcription of relBE is required to maintain a proper RelB:RelE ratio during starvation. Thus relBE may be regarded as a previously uncharacterized type of stress-response element that reduces the global level of translation during nutritional stress.},

DESIGN: An open phase II observational trial of GnRH analogues. Serial measurements of gonadotrophins, sex hormones and tumour dimensions were made together with repeat biopsy when possible to assess the response to treatment. SETTING: The outpatient clinics of the Department of Medical Oncology at The Royal London, Royal Marsden and St Bartholomew's hospitals. SUBJECTS: 17 patients with endometrial cancer which had recurred after surgery, radiotherapy and progesterone treatment and was symptomatic, progressive and assessable for response. INTERVENTION: Monthly subcutaneous injection of GnRH analogue. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reduction in serum gonadotrophins and reduction in tumour dimensions. RESULTS: Six out of 17 patients (35{\%}, 95{\%} CI 12.6-58{\%}) achieved a complete or partial remission which continues for a median of 20 months with no adverse effects. CONCLUSION: GnRH analogues have a significant antitumour effect in recurrent endometrial cancer which warrants further examination in comparison with progestogens.},

abstract = {Staphylococcal food poisoning is one of the most prevalent causes of foodborne intoxication worldwide. It is caused by ingestion of enterotoxins formed by Staphylococcus aureus during growth in the food matrix. Following a recall of barbecue cheese due to the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxins in Switzerland in July 2015, we analyzed the production process of the respective dairy. Although most cheese-making processes involve acidification to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, barbecue cheese has to maintain a pH {\textgreater}6.0 to prevent undesired melting of the cheese. In addition, the dairy decided to retain the traditional manual production process of the barbecue cheese. In this study, therefore, we aimed to (1) trace Staph. aureus along the barbecue cheese production process, and (2) develop a sustainable strategy to inhibit growth of Staph. aureus and decrease the risk of staphylococcal food poisoning without changing the traditional production process. To this end, we traced Staph. aureus in a step-wise blinded process analysis on 4 different production days using spa (Staphylococcus protein A gene) typing, DNA microarray profiling, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis. We subsequently selected a new starter culture and used a model cheese production including a challenge test assay to assess its antagonistic effect on Staph. aureus growth, as well as its sensory and technological implications. We detected Staph. aureus in 30{\%} (37/124) of the collected samples taken from the barbecue cheese production at the dairy. This included detection of Staph. aureus in the final product on all 4 production days, either after enrichment or using quantitative detection. We traced 2 enterotoxigenic Staph. aureus strains (t073/CC45 and t282/CC45) colonizing the nasal cavity and the forearms of the cheesemakers to the final product. In the challenge test assay, we were able to show that the new starter culture inhibited growth of Staph. aureus while meeting the sensory and technological requirements of barbecue cheese production.},

Earlier we reported that rpoB12 suppresses over-expression of cps genes in $\Delta$lon mutant of E. coli, by interfering with the transcription of rcsA. Here we report Microarray based Transcriptome profile of $\Delta$lon and $\Delta$lon rpoB12 strains. The data analyses clearly reveal that rpoB12 mutation results in the differential expression of â¼450 genes. The transcription profiles of some of the genes namely, rcsA, gadE, csgD, bolA, ypdI, dnaJ, clpP, csrA and hdeA are significantly altered, particularly the genes implicated in virulence. Some of the phenotypic traits namely, biofilm formation, motility, curli synthesis and ability to withstand acidic stress in a lon+rpoB12 strain were assessed. The results clearly indicate that rpoB12 up-regulates biofilm formation and curli synthesis while it makes the cells sensitive for growth in acidic medium and inhibits motility almost completely. Furthermore, rpoB12 modulates the expression profile of a significant number of genes involved in stress responses, genes encoding small RNAs. Thus, this study reveals the versatile role of the rpoB12 mutation, especially its impact on the regulation of genes related to virulence and highlights its medical importance.},

abstract = {Faced with complex patterns of global change, the inextricable interconnection of humans, pet animals, livestock and wildlife and their social and ecological environment is evident and requires integrated approaches to human and animal health and their respective social and environmental contexts. The history of integrative thinking of human and animal health is briefly reviewed from early historical times, to the foundation of universities in Europe, up to the beginning of comparative medicine at the end of the 19th century. In the 20th century, Calvin Schwabe coined the concept of "one medicine". It recognises that there is no difference of paradigm between human and veterinary medicine and both disciplines can contribute to the development of each other. Considering a broader approach to health and well-being of societies, the original concept of "one medicine" was extended to "one health" through practical implementations and careful validations in different settings. Given the global health thinking in recent decades, ecosystem approaches to health have emerged. Based on complex ecological thinking that goes beyond humans and animals, these approaches consider inextricable linkages between ecosystems and health, known as "ecosystem health". Despite these integrative conceptual and methodological developments, large portions of human and animal health thinking and actions still remain in separate disciplinary silos. Evidence for added value of a coherent application of "one health" compared to separated sectorial thinking is, however, now growing. Integrative thinking is increasingly being considered in academic curricula, clinical practice, ministries of health and livestock/agriculture and international organizations. Challenges remain, focusing around key questions such as how does "one health" evolve and what are the elements of a modern theory of health? The close interdependence of humans and animals in their social and ecological context relates to the concept of "human-environmental systems", also called "social-ecological systems". The theory and practice of understanding and managing human activities in the context of social-ecological systems has been well-developed by members of The Resilience Alliance and was used extensively in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, including its work on human well-being outcomes. This in turn entails systems theory applied to human and animal health. Examples of successful systems approaches to public health show unexpected results. Analogous to "systems biology" which focuses mostly on the interplay of proteins and molecules at a sub-cellular level, a systemic approach to health in social-ecological systems (HSES) is an inter- and trans-disciplinary study of complex interactions in all health-related fields. HSES moves beyond "one health" and "eco-health", expecting to identify emerging properties and determinants of health that may arise from a systemic view ranging across scales from molecules to the ecological and socio-cultural context, as well from the comparison with different disease endemicities and health systems structures.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli is an important pathogen that shows increasing antimicrobial resistance in isolates from both animals and humans. Our laboratory recently described Salmonella isolates from food animals and humans that expressed an identical plasmid-mediated, AmpC-like beta-lactamase, CMY-2. In the present study, 59 of 377 E. coli isolates from cattle and swine (15.6{\%}) and 6 of 1,017 (0.6{\%}) isolates of human E. coli from the same geographic region were resistant to both cephamycins and extended-spectrum cephalosporins. An ampC gene could be amplified with CMY-2 primers in 94.8{\%} of animal and 33{\%} of human isolates. Molecular epidemiological studies of chromosomal DNA revealed little clonal relatedness among the animal and human E. coli isolates harboring the CMY-2 gene. The ampC genes from 10 animal and human E. coli isolates were sequenced, and all carried an identical CMY-2 gene. Additionally, all were able to transfer a plasmid containing the CMY-2 gene to a laboratory strain of E. coli. CMY-2 plasmids demonstrated two different plasmid patterns that each showed strong similarities to previously described Salmonella CMY-2 plasmids. Additionally, Southern blot analyses using a CMY-2 probe demonstrated conserved fragments among many of the CMY-2 plasmids identified in Salmonella and E. coli isolates from food animals and humans. These data demonstrate that common plasmids have been transferred between animal-associated Salmonella and E. coli, and identical CMY-2 genes carried by similar plasmids have been identified in humans, suggesting that the CMY-2 plasmid has undergone transfer between different bacterial species and may have been transmitted between food animals and humans.},

abstract = {The interaction of high density lipoproteins (HDL) with the HDL receptor stimulates the translocation of cholesterol from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane where the cholesterol becomes available for removal by appropriate acceptors. The role of signal transduction through protein kinase C in HDL receptor-dependent cholesterol translocation and efflux was examined using cholesterol-loaded cultured human skin fibroblasts. Treatment of cells with HDL3 activated protein kinase C, demonstrated by a transient increase in membrane associated kinase activity. Kinase activation appeared to be dependent on binding of HDL3 to the HDL receptor, since tetranitromethane-modified HDL3, which does not bind to the receptor, was without effect. Translocation of intracellular sterol to the plasma membrane was stimulated by treatment of cells with the protein kinase C activators, dioctanoylglycerol and phorbol myristic acetate, and the calcium ionophore A23187. Conversely, treatment of cells with sphingosine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, reduced HDL3-mediated translocation and efflux of intracellular sterols. However, sphingosine had no effect on efflux of labeled cholesterol derived from the plasma membrane. Down-regulation of cellular protein kinase C activity by long term incubation with phorbol esters also inhibited HDL3-mediated efflux of intracellular sterols and abolished the ability of sphingosine to further inhibit HDL3-mediated efflux. These studies support the conclusion that HDL receptor-mediated translocation and efflux of intracellular cholesterol occurs through activation of protein kinase C.},

abstract = {Bacteria are killed by a variety of lethal stressors, some of which promote a cascade of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Perturbations expected to alter ROS accumulation affect the lethal action of diverse antibacterials, leading to the hypothesis that killing by these agents can involve ROS-mediated self-destruction. Recent challenges to the hypothesis are considered, particularly with respect to complexities in assays that distinguish primary damage from the cellular response to that damage. Also considered are bifunctional factors that are protective at low stress levels but destructive at high levels. These considerations, plus new data, support an involvement of ROS in the lethal action of some antimicrobials and raise important questions concerning consumption of antioxidant dietary supplements during antimicrobial chemotherapy. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {MarR, the negative regulator of the Escherichia coli multiple antibiotic resistance (marRAB) operon, is a member of a newly recognized family of regulatory proteins. The amino acid sequences of these proteins do not display any apparent homologies to the DNA binding domains of prokaryotic transcription regula-tors and a DNA binding motif for any one of the MarR homologues is currently unknown. In order to define regions of MarR required for DNA binding, mutant repressors, selected based on their ability to interfere with (negatively complement) the activity of wild-type MarR, were isolated. As determined using gel mobi-lity shift assays, 13 out of 14 negative complementing mutants tested were unable to bind DNA in vitro. Three negative complementing alleles presumably specify truncated repressors and one of these proteins, a 120 residue MarR, can bind DNA in vitro. Most of the negative complementing mutations were clustered within two areas of MarR with features related to a helixÂ±turnÂ±helix DNA binding motif. These regions are presumed to be required for the DNA binding activity of the repressor.},

abstract = {The present study was conducted to assess the prevalence of retail chicken and turkey meat colonized by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBLEC) in Seville, Spain. ESBLEC recovered from meat samples purchased in 2010 were characterized by specific PCR analysis for bla genes, phylogenetic groups and subgroups (genotypes) and O25b/pabB/B2 traits of ST131. Results were compared with those obtained in a previous study in 2007, when a high percentage of retail meat samples were found to be colonized by ESBLEC. The prevalence of retail poultry meat colonized by ESBLEC increased from 62.5{\%} in 2007 to 93.3{\%} in 2010 (p=0.005). Non-pathogenic B1 and A(1) genotypes accounted for more than 60{\%} of the 60 isolates recovered. Sequence type ST131 or B2 phylogroup isolates were not detected. Clonal relatedness was detected in just 2 CTX-M-1-producing isolates from 2 chicken samples belonging to phylogenetic group A, genotype A(1). There continued to be a significantly high quinolone resistance, with 85.4{\%} and 32.2{\%} of isolates showing resistance to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, respectively. SHV-12 was the most common ESBL harbored by E. coli, although it has decreased in prevalence since 2007. Meanwhile, CTX-M ESBLs prevalence has increased. We conclude that the trend of colonization by ESBLECs-particularly CTX-M-producing isolates-in raw poultry meat has increased in a short period of time in our area.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli isolates (n=438) from six different broiler chicken flocks (all in, all out) with known consumption of antimicrobials were investigated for their antimicrobial resistance and the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotypes. E. coli were isolated from chicken at the third and fifth week of age and tested for antimicrobial resistance during the course of fattening. Resistance to sulfamethoxazole+trimethoprim, which was used in four flocks within the first days of life, decreased significantly in all six flocks between the third and fifth week of broiler chicken's life (mean 65.9{\%} vs. 54.3{\%}). By contrast, resistance to spectinomycin increased significantly in all six flocks within the same period (mean 36.1{\%} vs. 57.0{\%}); doxycycline resistance increased significantly in five of six flocks (mean 19.2{\%} vs. 41.7{\%}), although both substances were not used for treatment. Of the sulfonamide resistance genes sul1, sul2, and sul3, sul2 was most frequently found (up to 60{\%}). The prevalence of sul2 increased significantly between weeks 3 and 5, if the chicken were treated with sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim in the first days of life. If sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim was not used, then the prevalence of sul2 decreased significantly in the same period. The prevalence of sul1+qacEDelta1 (classical class 1 integrons) was significantly higher in E. coli from sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim-treated flocks (9.63{\%}), compared to untreated flocks (2.92{\%}). The detection of phenotypes that potentially indicate plasmid-borne AmpC-beta-lactamases was inversely associated with sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim treatment. ESBL phenotypes were found without selective enrichment in four of six flocks. Of all isolated E. coli, 1.8{\%} (n=8) had an ESBL phenotype. ESBL strains differed in their accompanying resistances and/or enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequences. In conclusion, clonal dissemination seems not to be a major cause of ESBL detection on a chicken farm with all-in all-out production mode.},

Fluoroquinolones, antimicrobial agents used extensively in medicine and agriculture, are synthetic and have been considered safe from naturally occurring antimicrobial-modifying enzymes. We describe reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin in clinical bacterial isolates conferred by a variant of the gene encoding aminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC(6')-Ib. This enzyme reduces the activity of ciprofloxacin by N-acetylation at the amino nitrogen on its piperazinyl substituent. Although approximately 30 variants of this gene have been reported since 1986, the two base-pair changes responsible for the ciprofloxacin modification phenotype are unique to this variant, first reported in 2003 and now widely disseminated. An intense increase in the medical use of ciprofloxacin seems to have been accompanied by a notable development: a single-function resistance enzyme has crossed class boundaries, and is now capable of enzymatically undermining two unrelated antimicrobial agents, one of them fully synthetic.},

Few data on the prevalence of these determinants in strains from animals are available. The presence of PMQR genes in isolates from animals was determined by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. The production of extended-spectrum â¤-lactamases (ESBLs) and AmpC â¤-lactamases in the strains was detected, and their genotypes were determined. The genetic environment of PMQR determinants in selected plasmids was ana-lyzed. All samples of ceftiofur-resistant (MICs {\textgreater} 8 â®g/ml) isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae were selected from 36 companion animals and 65 food-producing animals in Guangdong Province, China, between November 2003 and April 2007, including 89 Escherichia coli isolates, 9 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, and isolates of three other genera. A total of 68.3{\%} (69/101) of the isolates produced ESBLs and/or AmpC â¤-lactamases, mainly those of the CTX-M and CMY types. Of the 101 strains, PMQR determinants were present in 35 (34.7{\%}) isolates, with qnr, aac(6Ø)-Ib-cr, and qepA detected alone or in combination in 8 (7.9{\%}), 19 (18.8{\%}), and 16 (15.8{\%}) strains, respectively. The qnr genes detected included one qnrB4 gene, four qnrB6 genes, and three qnrS1 genes. Five strains were positive for both aac(6Ø)-Ib-cr and qepA, while one strain was positive for qnrS1, aac(6Ø)-Ib-cr, and qepA. qnrB6 was flanked by two copies of ISCR1 with an intervening dfr gene downstream and sul1 and qacEâ¬1 genes upstream. In another plasmid, aac(6Ø)-Ib-cr followed intI1 and arr-3 was downstream. PMQR determinants are highly prevalent in ceftiofur-resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from animals in China. This is the first report of the occurrence of PMQR determinants among isolates from companion animals.},

The fate of a resistance mutation in pathogen populations is determined in part by its fitness. Mutations that suffer little or no fitness cost are more likely to persist in the absence of antibiotic treatment. In this review, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate the fitness costs associated with single mutational events that confer resistance. Generally, these mutations were costly, although several drug classes and species of bacteria on average did not show a cost. Further investigations into the rate and fitness values of compensatory mutations that alleviate the costs of resistance will help us to better understand both the emergence and management of antibiotic resistance in clinical settings.},

abstract = {Epidemiological evidence suggests that flavonoids may play an important role in the decreased risk of chronic diseases associated with a diet rich in plant-derived foods. Flavonoids are also common constituents of plants used in traditional medicine to treat a wide range of diseases. The purpose of this article is to summarize the distribution and biological activities of one of the most common flavonoids: luteolin. This flavonoid and its glycosides are widely distributed in the plant kingdom; they are present in many plant families and have been identified in Bryophyta, Pteridophyta, Pinophyta and Magnoliophyta. Dietary sources of luteolin include, for instance, carrots, peppers, celery, olive oil, peppermint, thyme, rosemary and oregano. Preclinical studies have shown that this flavone possesses a variety of pharmacological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and anticancer activities. The ability of luteolin to inhibit angiogenesis, to induce apoptosis, to prevent carcinogenesis in animal models, to reduce tumor growth in vivo and to sensitize tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of some anticancer drugs suggests that this flavonoid has cancer chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic potential. Modulation of ROS levels, inhibition of topoisomerases I and II, reduction of NF-kappaB and AP-1 activity, stabilization of p53, and inhibition of PI3K, STAT3, IGF1R and HER2 are possible mechanisms involved in the biological activities of luteolin.},

abstract = {SdiA is an Escherichia coli protein that regulates cell division in a cell density-dependent, or quorum-sensing, manner. We report that SdiA also controls multidrug resistance by positively regulating the multidrug resistance pump AcrAB. Overproduction of SdiA confers multidrug resistance and increased levels of AcrAB. Conversely, sdiA null mutants are hypersensitive to drugs and have decreased levels of AcrB protein. Our findings provide a link between quorum sensing and multidrug efflux. Combined with previously published reports, our data support a model in which a role of drug efflux pumps is to mediate cellâcell communication in response to cell density. Xenobiotics expelled by pumps may resemble the communication molecules that they normally efflux.},

abstract = {Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) are increasing rapidly worldwide. E. coli producing CTX-M type ESBLs are the most common clinically encountered. The majority of E. coli ESBL infections are represented by urinary tract infections, but they can also cause severe infections, for example, in the blood stream and central nervous system. Since E. coli is a common colonizer of the normal gut microbiota, increasing prevalence of ESBL-producing strains is particularly worrisome. Once disseminated in the community, containment of this resistance type will be challenging. The driver of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (EPE) is debated. Some suggest that the ESBL genes were introduced to particularly successful bacterial clones. Others imply that very successful plasmids drive the rapid dissemination. More research and epidemiological studies of strain types, plasmids and mobile genetic elements are needed for these questions to be answered. In order to combat, or at least slow down, the worrisome trend of increasing numbers of EPE more knowledge is also needed on persistence of EPE in carriers as well as better understanding of how antibiotic treatment and other risk factors affect persistence and further dissemination. This review aims at giving an overview of this global problem from a Nordic perspective.},

abstract = {Large phylogenomics data sets require fast tree inference methods, especially for maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies. Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2{\%} and 87.1{\%} of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in 75.7{\%} and 47.1{\%} of the DNA alignments and 42.2{\%} and 100{\%} of the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of obtaining higher likelihoods with IQ-TREE improves to 73.3-97.1{\%}. IQ-TREE is freely available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree.},

In some patients the mechanism of the tachycardia was investigated and drug-electrophysiologic studies also performed. Two of 6 cases with recurrent syncope had positive electrophysiologic findings and adequate treatment resolved the symptoms. The others have been followed. The mechanism of the tachycardia was determined in 5 cases with drug refractory supraventricular tachycardia and drug-electrophysiologic studies were done in all of them. The site of block was determined in 7 patients with atrioventricular block and pacemaker implantation was done in 5 patients. The results emphasized the usefulness of cardiac electrophysiologic study in childhood arrhythmias.},

abstract = {We previously reported the first 'reverse antibiotic' (RA), nybomycin (NYB), which showed a unique antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus strains. NYB specifically suppressed the growth of quinolone-resistant S. aureus strains but was not effective against quinolone-susceptible strains. Although NYB was first reported in 1955, little was known about its unique antimicrobial activity because it was before the synthesis of the first quinolone ('old quinolone'), nalidixic acid, in 1962. Following our re-discovery of NYB, we looked for other RAs among natural substances that act on quinolone-resistant bacteria. Commercially available flavones were screened against S. aureus, including quinolone-resistant strains, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were compared using the microbroth dilution method. Some of the flavones screened showed stronger antimicrobial activity against quinolone-resistant strains than against quinolone-susceptible ones. Amongst them, apigenin (API) was the most potent in its RA activity. DNA cleavage assay showed that API inhibited DNA gyrase harbouring the quinolone resistance mutation gyrA(Ser84Leu) but did not inhibit 'wild-type' DNA gyrase that is sensitive to levofloxacin. An API-susceptible S. aureus strain Mu50 was also selected using agar plates containing 20 mg/L API. Whole-genome sequencing of selected mutant strains was performed and frequent back-mutations (reverse mutations) were found among API-resistant strains derived from the API-susceptible S. aureus strains. Here we report that API represents another molecular class of natural antibiotic having RA activity against quinolone-resistant bacteria.},

abstract = {AIMS: To investigate the transmission of Salmonella spp. between production animals (pigs and cattle) and wildlife on production animal farms in Denmark. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the winter and summer of 2001 and 2002, 3622 samples were collected from Salmonella-infected and noninfected herds of pigs and cattle and surrounding wildlife. Salmonella was detected in wildlife on farms carrying Salmonella-positive production animals and only during the periods when Salmonella was detected in the production animals. The presence of Salmonella Typhimurium in wild birds significantly correlated to their migration pattern and food preference. CONCLUSIONS: Salmonella was transmitted from infected herds of production animals (cattle and pigs) to wildlife that lived amongst or in close proximity to them. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Salmonella in animal food products is associated with the occurrence of Salmonella in primary animal production. Strategies to control the introduction and spread of infection should include wildlife management, as the nearby wildlife may act as reservoirs for Salmonella spp. and/or may be passive carriers of the bacteria.},

Thirty-four original, peer-reviewed publications were identified for inclusion. Six molecular epidemiology studies supported the transfer of resistance via whole bacterium transmission (WBT), which was best characterized among poultry in the Netherlands. Thirteen molecular epidemiology studies supported transmission of resistance via mobile genetic elements, which demonstrated greater diversity of geography and host FPA. Seventeen molecular epidemiology studies did not support WBT and two did not support mobile genetic element-mediated transmission. Four observational epidemiology studies were consistent with zoonotic transmission. Overall, there is evidence that a proportion of human extraintestinal ESCR-EC infections originate from FPAs. Poultry, in particular, is probably a source, but the quantitative and geographical extent of the problem is unclear and requires further investigation.},

abstract = {The anthocyanidin delphinidin (DEL) has recently been shown to inhibit human topoisomerase I and II, without stabilizing the covalent DNA/topoisomerase intermediate [Habermeyer, M., Fritz, J., Barthelmes, H. U., Christensen, M. O., Larsen, M. K., Boege, F., and Marko, D. (2005) Anthocyanidins modulate the activity of human DNA topoisomerases I and II and affect cellular DNA integrity. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 18, 1395-404]. In the present study, we demonstrated that DEL affects the catalytic activity of topoisomerase IIalpha in a redox-independent manner. Furthermore, this potent inhibitory effect is not limited to a cell-free system, but is also of relevance within intact cells. DEL at micromolar concentrations was found to significantly decrease the level of topoisomerase IIalpha/DNA intermediates stabilized by the topoisomerase II poison doxorubicin in the human colon carcinoma cell line (HT29). In addition, DEL diminished the DNA-damaging properties of topoisomerase II poisons in HT29 cells without affecting the level of sites sensitive to formamidopyrimidine-DNA-glycosylase. However, the preventive effect on DNA damage exhibited an apparent maximum at a concentration of 10 microM DEL, followed by a recurrence of DNA damage at higher DEL concentrations. Furthermore, the incubation of HT29 cells with 10 microM DEL resulted in a decrease of etoposide (ETO)-induced DNA strand breaks. However, the level of ETO-stabilized covalent topoisomerase/DNA intermediates did not affect DEL, indicating an additional mechanism of action. An impact of DEL on genes involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and the onset of apoptosis has to be considered. In conclusion, the natural food constituent DEL represents, depending on the concentration range, a protective factor against the DNA-damaging effects of topoisomerase II poisons in vitro. Further studies are needed to clarify whether in vivo a high DEL intake might compromise the therapeutic outcome of these anticancer agents.},

Different mobile genetic elements, which have different characteristics, are responsible for capturing these genes from the chromosomes of a variety of bacterial species and moving them between DNA molecules. If transferred to plasmids, these resistance genes are then able to be transferred 'horizontally' between different bacterial cells, including different species, and well as being transferred 'vertically' during cell division. Carriage of several resistance genes on the same plasmid enables a bacterial cell to acquire multi-resistance in a single step and means that spread of one resistance gene may be co-selected for by use of antibiotics other than those to which it confers resistance. Many different mobile genes conferring resistance to each class of antibiotic have been identified, complicating detection of the factors responsible for a particular resistance phenotype, especially when changes in chromosomal genes may also confer or contribute to resistance. Understanding the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and the means by which these mechanisms can evolve and disseminate, is important for developing ways to efficiently track the spread of resistance and to optimise treatment.},

abstract = {Critically ill patients often develop symptoms of sepsis and therefore require microbiological tests for bacteremia that use conventional blood culture (BC) techniques. However, since these patients frequently receive early empirical antibiotic therapy before diagnostic procedures are completed, examination by BC can return false-negative results. We therefore hypothesized that PCR could improve the rate of detection of microbial pathogens over that of BC. To test this hypothesis, male Wistar rats were challenged intravenously with 10(6) CFU of Escherichia coli. Blood was then taken at several time points for detection of E. coli by BC and by PCR with E. coli-specific primers derived from the uidA gene, encoding beta-glucuronidase. In further experiments, cefotaxime (100 or 50 mg/kg of body weight) was administered intravenously to rats 10 min after E. coli challenge. Without this chemotherapy, the E. coli detection rate decreased at 15 min and at 210 min after challenge from 100{\%} to 62{\%} of the animals with PCR and from 100{\%} to 54{\%} of the animals with BC (P, {\textgreater}0.05). Chemotherapy decreased the E. coli detection rate at 25 min and at 55 min after challenge from 100{\%} to 50{\%} with PCR and from 100{\%} to 0{\%} with BC (P, {\textless}0.05). Thus, at clinically relevant serum antibiotic levels, PCR affords a significantly higher detection rate than BC in this rat model. The results suggest that PCR could be a useful adjunct tool supplementing conventional BC techniques in diagnosing bacteremia.},

Primers were designed to amplify conserved fragments of qnrABCDS, qepA, oqxAB and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes and were optimized in uniplex and multiplex PCR assays with control template DNA. The assay was used to determine the prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes in 174 ciprofloxacin-resistant and 43 ciprofloxacin-susceptible extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli isolates. Each resistance gene could be detected alone and in combination. PMQR determinants were detected in 65 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates (37 {\%}) and one ciprofloxacin-susceptible isolate (2 {\%}). Prevalences of the identified determinants were: aac(6')-Ib-cr, 34.5 {\%}; qnrS, 1.1 {\%}; qepA, 1.1 {\%}; and oqxAB, 0.6 {\%}. In conclusion, we developed an eight-target multiplex PCR for the accurate detection of PMQR genes and confirmed that PMQR prevalence remains low among human Escherichia coli clinical isolates in the UK.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Limitations of genome sequencing techniques have led to dozens of assembly algorithms, none of which is perfect. A number of methods for comparing assemblers have been developed, but none is yet a recognized benchmark. Further, most existing methods for comparing assemblies are only applicable to new assemblies of finished genomes; the problem of evaluating assemblies of previously unsequenced species has not been adequately considered. Here, we present QUAST-a quality assessment tool for evaluating and comparing genome assemblies. This tool improves on leading assembly comparison software with new ideas and quality metrics. QUAST can evaluate assemblies both with a reference genome, as well as without a reference. QUAST produces many reports, summary tables and plots to help scientists in their research and in their publications. In this study, we used QUAST to compare several genome assemblers on three datasets. QUAST tables and plots for all of them are available in the Supplementary Material, and interactive versions of these reports are on the QUAST website.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: http://bioinf.spbau.ru/quast .$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {The lipocalins were once regarded as a eukaryotic protein family, but new members have been recently discovered in bacteria. The first bacterial lipocalin (Blc) was identified in Escherichia coli as an outer membrane lipoprotein expressed under conditions of environmental stress. Blc is distinguished from most lipocalins by the absence of intramolecular disulfide bonds, but the presence of a membrane anchor is shared with two of its closest homologues, apolipoprotein D and lazarillo. Several common features of the membrane-anchored lipocalins suggest that each may play an important role in membrane biogenesis and repair. Additionally, Blc proteins are implicated in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes and in the activation of immunity. Recent genome sequencing efforts reveal the existence of at least 20 bacterial lipocalins. The lipocalins appear to have originated in Gram-negative bacteria and were probably transferred horizontally to eukaryotes from the endosymbiotic alpha-proteobacterial ancestor of the mitochondrion. The genome sequences also reveal that some bacterial lipocalins exhibit disulfide bonds and alternative modes of subcellular localization, which include targeting to the periplasmic space, the cytoplasmic membrane, and the cytosol. The relationships between bacterial lipocalin structure and function further illuminate the common biochemistry of bacterial and eukaryotic cells.},

abstract = {A longitudinal study of 27 broiler farms including 182 broiler flocks was performed to determine risk factors for occurrence of cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli in Norwegian broiler flocks. Information regarding possible risk factors was collected by an online questionnaire and by samples obtained from broiler and parent flocks during the study period. Additional information was provided by the broiler production company. The prevalence of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in parent flocks and broiler flocks sampled in the study was estimated. Cephalosporin-resistant E. coli was detected in 13.8{\%} of the parent flocks and 22.5{\%} of the broiler flocks included in the study. A multivariable generalized linear model was used to estimate risk factors. The risk for occurrence of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli was associated with the status of the previous flock in the broiler house (odds ratio=12.7), number of parent flocks supplying the broiler flock with day-old chickens (odds ratio=6.3), routines for disinfection of floor between production cycles (odds ratio=0.1), and transport personnel entering the room where the broilers are raised (odds ratio=9.3). Our findings highlights that implementation of a high level of biosecurity with a minimal number of people entering the broiler house during production cycles, as well as rigorous cleaning and disinfection routines between production cycles will contribute to a decrease in the occurrence of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in broiler flocks provided that there is no selection pressure from antimicrobial use in the broiler production.},

abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated that E. coli appears to display some level of host adaptation and specificity. Recent studies in our laboratory support these findings as determined by logic regression modeling of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in intergenic regions (ITGRs). We sought to determine the degree of host-specific information encoded in various ITGRs across a library of animal E. coli isolates using both whole genome analysis and a targeted ITGR sequencing approach. Our findings demonstrated that ITGRs across the genome encode various degrees of host-specific information. Incorporating multiple ITGRs (i.e., concatenation) into logic regression model building resulted in greater host-specificity and sensitivity outcomes in biomarkers, but the overall level of polymorphism in an ITGR did not correlate with the degree of host-specificity encoded in the ITGR. This suggests that distinct SNPs in ITGRs may be more important in defining host-specificity than overall sequence variation, explaining why traditional unsupervised learning phylogenetic approaches may be less informative in terms of revealing host-specific information encoded in DNA sequence. In silico analysis of 80 candidate ITGRs from publically available E. coli genomes was performed as a tool for discovering highly host-specific ITGRs. In one ITGR (ydeR-yedS) we identified a SNP biomarker that was 98{\%} specific for cattle and for which 92{\%} of all E. coli isolates originating from cattle carried this unique biomarker. In the case of humans, a host-specific biomarker (98{\%} specificity) was identified in the concatenated ITGR sequences of rcsD-ompC, ydeR-yedS, and rclR-ykgE, and for which 78{\%} of E. coli originating from humans carried this biomarker. Interestingly, human-specific biomarkers were dominant in ITGRs regulating antibiotic resistance, whereas in cattle host-specific biomarkers were found in ITGRs involved in stress regulation. These data suggest that evolution towards host specificity may be driven by different natural selection pressures on the regulome of E. coli among different animal hosts.},

Every subject was interviewed concerning history of allergy, smoking habits and the other risk factors for coronary arterial disease. In a model including the factors that may affect the serum levels of IgE (namely, age, sex, cigarette smoking, parasites, and family and personal history of allergy), IgE levels were found to be significantly higher in the patients with unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction compared to the patients with stable angina pectoris and controls.

abstract = {The intestinal flora of healthy broilers can contain Escherichia coli resistant to extended spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) and fluoroquinolones (FQ), representing a possible public health problem. We investigated the clonal epidemiology of E. coli with reduced susceptibility to ESC or FQ in broilers in three Nordic countries interconnected by a common source of breeding animals. Isolates (n = 319 and n = 132 non-wild type for ESC and FQ, respectively) from Norwegian, Swedish and Icelandic production originated mainly from the intestinal flora of broilers at the age of 20â35 days. Genetic relationships were investigated by ten loci multilocus variable number tandem repeat analyses (MLVA) and representative isolates of inter-Nordic clusters were subjected to multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Antimicrobial susceptibility data based on minimum inhibitory concentrations was compiled. Approximately one third of the ESC non-wild type isolates, including isolates from all three countries, clustered together. These isolates belonged to sequence type (ST) 38 and contained blaCMY-2. The FQ non-wild type isolates were more genetically diverse, but related isolates occurred in more than one country. MLST typing showed clusters belonging to ST10, ST355, ST349, ST665 and ST93. Our study demonstrated inter-Nordic distribution of E. coli ST38 with blaCMY-2 suggesting clonal proliferation as a contributing factor for spread of ESC resistance in the broiler production. The international trade in breeding material may explain introduction of resistant E. coli. The reason for their success and the success of certain clonal lineages in broiler production not exposed to antimicrobial selection pressure is currently unknown.},

abstract = {The use of antimicrobials in production animals has become a worldwide concern in the face of rising resistance levels in commensal, pathogenic and zoonotic bacteria. In the years 2007 and 2008 antimicrobial consumption records were collected during two non consecutive production cycles in 32 randomly selected Belgian broiler farms. Antimicrobials were used in 48 of the 64 monitored production cycles, 7 farms did not use any antimicrobials in both production cycles, 2 farms only administered antimicrobials in one of the two production cycles, the other 23 farms applied antimicrobial treatment in both production cycles. For the quantification of antimicrobial drug use, the treatment incidences (TI) based on the defined daily doses (the dose as it should be applied: DDD) and used daily doses (the actual dose applied: UDD) were calculated. A mean antimicrobial treatment incidence per 1000 animals of 131.8 (standard deviation 126.8) animals treated daily with one DDD and 121.4 (SD 106.7) animals treated daily with one UDD was found. The most frequently used compounds were amoxicillin, tylosin and trimethoprim-sulphonamide with a mean TI(UDD) of 37.9, 34.8, and 21.7, respectively. The ratio of the UDD/DDD gives an estimate on correctness of dosing. Tylosin was underdosed in most of the administrations whereas amoxicillin and trimethoprim-sulphonamide were slightly overdosed in the average flock.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to determine the interplay between the plasmid-mediated qepA2 gene and multiple chromosomally mediated fluoroquinolone resistance determinants in the development of fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia coli and its influence on bacterial fitness. METHODS E. coli ATCC 25922 and derived isogenic strains harbouring different chromosomally mediated fluoroquinolone resistance determinants were electroporated with pBK-CMV vector encoding QepA2. The MICs of fluoroquinolones were determined by standardized microdilution. The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) was evaluated. Bacterial fitness was analysed using $\Delta$lacZ system competition assays. RESULTS The ciprofloxacin MIC for strains harbouring the qepA2 gene was 4- to 8-fold higher compared with strains without the qepA2 gene. The qepA2 gene also increased the MPC of ciprofloxacin 4- to 16-fold. Combination of the qepA2 gene plus two to three additional mechanisms conferred a clinically relevant resistance level. The presence of the qepA2 gene was associated with fitness costs in strains with mutations in the gyrA and/or parC genes, although the presence of an additional deletion of the marR gene compensated for this fitness cost by increasing bacterial fitness by 5{\%}-23{\%}. CONCLUSIONS The additive effect of chromosomally mediated fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms and the qepA2 gene led to clinical levels of fluoroquinolone resistance. Under competitive conditions, the qepA2 gene had a biological cost in E. coli that was compensated for by the presence of an additional deletion in the marR gene.},

abstract = {Cronobacter turicensis is an opportunistic foodborne pathogen that can cause a rare but sometimes lethal infection in neonates. Little is known about the virulence mechanisms and intracellular lifestyle of this pathogen. In this study, we developed an IgG monoclonal antibody (MAb; MAb 2G4) that specifically recognizes the O1 antigen of C. turicensis cells. The antilipopolysaccharide antibody bound predominantly monovalently to the O antigen and reduced bacterial growth without causing cell agglutination. Furthermore, binding of the antibody to the O1 antigen of C. turicensis cells caused a significant reduction of the membrane potential which is required to energize flagellar rotation, accompanied by a decreased flagellum-based motility. These results indicate that binding of IgG to the O antigen of C. turicensis causes a direct antimicrobial effect. In addition, this feature of the antibody enabled new insight into the pathogenicity of C. turicensis. In a tissue culture infection model, pretreatment of C. turicensis with MAb 2G4 showed no difference in adhesion to human epithelial cells, whereas invasion of bacteria into Caco-2 cells was significantly inhibited.},

The study found that some sublethal stresses significantly altered antibiotic resistance. Incubation at sublethal high temperature (45 degrees C) decreased ABR. Incubation under increased salt ({\textgreater}4.5{\%}) or reduced pH ({\textless}5.0) conditions increased ABR. Some of the pathogens continued to express higher levels of ABR after removal of stress, suggesting that in some cases the applied sublethal stress had induced stable increases in ABR. These results indicate that increased use of bacteriostatic (sublethal), rather than bactericidal (lethal), food preservation systems may be contributing to the development and dissemination of ABR among important food-borne pathogens.},

abstract = {The current beta-lactamase classifications have reached a high level of complexity, making them less accessible to clinicians, infection control professionals, hospital management and politicians. From the clinical perspective, a revised comprehensible nomenclature scheme is therefore needed. The term extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) has reached a broader audience over time, but is currently restricted to functional class 2be/molecular class A, clavulanic acid inhibited enzymes with activity against extended-spectrum cephalosporins. The proposed new classification expands the definition of ESBL to other clinically important acquired beta-lactamases with activity against extended-spectrum cephalosporins and/or carbapenems. The classical class A ESBLs have been designated ESBLA in this classification, whereas plasmid-mediated AmpC and OXA-ESBLs are classed as miscellaneous ESBLs (ESBLM). Lastly, the carbapenemases have been designated ESBLCARBA, ESBLs with hydrolytic activity against carbapenems. We believe that this simplified classification may encourage new groups of healthcare professionals to engage in the effort to prevent the spread of acquired beta-lactamases.},

abstract = {The European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have analysed the information on antimicrobial resistance among zoonotic and indicator bacteria in 2009 submitted by 25 European Union Member States. This information covers antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella and Campylobacter isolates from humans, food and animals, and in indicator Escherichia coli and enterococci isolates from animals and food. Data on resistance in isolates from humans were mainly interpreted using clinical breakpoints, while for isolates from animals and food resistance was interpreted using the more sensitive epidemiological cut-off values. Resistance to antimicrobials was commonly found in isolates from humans, animals and food, although disparities in the occurrences of resistance were frequently observed between Member States. High resistance levels were recorded to ampicillin, tetracyclines and sulphonamides in Salmonella isolates from human cases, while resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, both critically important antimicrobial groups for human medicine, remained low. In Salmonella and indicator E. coli isolates from fowl, pigs, cattle and meat thereof, resistance to tetracyclines, ampicillin and sulphonamides was also commonly found, while resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was low. Moderate to high levels of ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) resistance was observed in Salmonella and indicator E. coli isolates from fowl, broiler meat and pigs. In Campylobacter isolates from human cases, resistance to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracyclines was high, while resistance to erythromycin, a critically important antimicrobial, was recorded at a low level. High resistance to ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid and tetracyclines was also observed in Campylobacter isolates from fowl, broiler meat, pigs and cattle, whereas erythromycin resistance was at lower levels. Among the indicator enterococci isolates from animals and food, resistance to tetracyclines and erythromycin was commonly detected.$\backslash$n},

The structural requirements of peptides for antiviral and antibacterial activities are evaluated in light of the diverse set of primary and secondary structures described for host defense peptides. Peptides with antifungal and antiparasitic activities are discussed in less detail, although the broad-spectrum activities of such peptides indicate that they are important host defense molecules.

Three different SOS gene fusions (recA::lacZ, umuC::lacZ and sulA::lacZ) have been introduced into the E.coli MC1061 strain to study the induction of these SOS genes in the same genetic background. Data on the basal level of expression of these fusions, as well as their induction by mitomycin C and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine are presented. Using these strains, we have found that, like nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin are strong inducers of the SOS genes tested, umuC gene expression being the highest. Furthermore, fluoroquinolones produced a significant increase in the reversion of the base substitution hisG428 mutation in the TA102 Salmonella tester strain, while no effect was found in strains TA98, TA100, TA1537 and TA1535. These data indicate that the error-prone repair pathway can participate in mutagenesis induced by fluoroquinolones and also that the damage produced by these chemicals may be similar to that produced by nalidixic acid.},

abstract = {Bacteria can become resistant not only by horizontal gene transfer or other forms of exchange of genetic information but also by de novo by adaptation at the gene expression level and through DNA mutations. The interrelationship between changes in gene expression and DNA mutations during acquisition of resistance is not well documented. In addition, it is not known whether the DNA mutations leading to resistance always occur in the same order and whether the final result is always identical. The expression of {\textgreater}4,000 genes in Escherichia coli was compared upon adaptation to amoxicillin, tetracycline, and enrofloxacin. During adaptation, known resistance genes were sequenced for mutations that cause resistance. The order of mutations varied within two sets of strains adapted in parallel to amoxicillin and enrofloxacin, respectively, whereas the buildup of resistance was very similar. No specific mutations were related to the rather modest increase in tetracycline resistance. Ribosome-sensed induction and efflux pump activation initially protected the cell through induction of expression and allowed it to survive low levels of antibiotics. Subsequently, mutations were promoted by the stress-induced SOS response that stimulated modulation of genetic instability, and these mutations resulted in resistance to even higher antibiotic concentrations. The initial adaptation at the expression level enabled a subsequent trial and error search for the optimal mutations. The quantitative adjustment of cellular processes at different levels accelerated the acquisition of antibiotic resistance.},

@article{Maiden1998,
abstract = {Traditional and molecular typing schemes for the characterization of pathogenic microorganisms are poorly portable because they index variation that is difficult to compare among laboratories. To overcome these problems, we propose multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which exploits the unambiguous nature and electronic portability of nucleotide sequence data for the characterization of microorganisms. To evaluate MLST, we determined the sequences of 470-bp fragments from 11 housekeeping genes in a reference set of 107 isolates of Neisseria meningitidis from invasive disease and healthy carriers. For each locus, alleles were assigned arbitrary numbers and dendrograms were constructed from the pairwise differences in multilocus allelic profiles by cluster analysis. The strain associations obtained were consistent with clonal groupings previously determined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. A subset of six gene fragments was chosen that retained the resolution and congruence achieved by using all 11 loci. Most isolates from hyper-virulent lineages of serogroups A, B, and C meningo-cocci were identical for all loci or differed from the majority type at only a single locus. MLST using six loci therefore reliably identified the major meningococcal lineages associated with invasive disease. MLST can be applied to almost all bacterial species and other haploid organisms, including those that are difficult to cultivate. The overwhelming advantage of MLST over other molecular typing methods is that sequence data are truly portable between laboratories, permitting one expanding global database per species to be placed on a WorldWide Web site, thus enabling exchange of molecular typing data for global epidemiology via the Internet.},

abstract = {Although previous studies have demonstrated high carriage of ESBL/AmpC-producing Escherichia coli in livestock, especially in broiler chickens, data on emission sources of these bacteria into the environment are still rare. Therefore, this study was designed to systematically investigate the occurrence of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in slurry, air (inside animal houses), ambient air (outside animal houses) and on soil surfaces in the areas surrounding of seven ESBL/AmpC-positive broiler chicken fattening farms, including investigation of the possible spread of these bacteria via the faecal route and/or exhaust air into the environment. Seven German broiler fattening farms were each investigated at three points in time (3-36h after restocking, 14-18 and 26-35 days after housing) during one fattening period. The occurrence of ESBL/AmpC genes in the investigated samples was confirmed by PCR, detecting blaCTX-M, blaSHV, blaTEM and blaCMY-genes, and, if necessary, by sequencing and/or the disc diffusion method. The results showed a wide spread of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in broiler farms, as well as emissions into the surroundings. 12 out of 14 (86{\%}) slurry samples were positive for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli. Additionally, 28.8{\%} (n=23/80) of boot swabs taken from various surfaces in the areas surrounding of the farms as well as 7.5{\%} (n=3/40) of the exhaust air samples turned out to be positive for these microorganisms. Moreover, a small proportion of air samples from inside the barns were ESBL/AmpC-positive. By comparing selected isolates using pulsed field gel electrophoresis, we proved that faecal and airborne transfer of ESBL/AmpC-producing microorganisms from broiler fattening farms to the surrounding areas is possible. Two isolates from farm G2 (slurry and boot swab 50m downwind), two isolates from farm G3 (slurry and individual animal swab) as well as two isolates from farm G6 (air sample in the barn and air sample 50m downwind) showed 100{\%} similarity in PFGE analysis.},

@article{Hawkey2009,
abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is now a linked global problem. Dispersion of successful clones of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria is common, often via the movement of people. Local evolution of MDR bacteria is also important under the pressure of excessive antibiotic use, with horizontal gene transfer providing the means by which genes such as bla(CTX-M) spread amongst different bacterial species and strains. Beta-lactamase production is a common resistance mechanism in Gram-negative bacteria, and the rapid dissemination of novel genes reflects their evolution under the selective pressure of antibiotic usage. Many Enterobacteriaceae now carry broad-spectrum beta-lactamases such as CTX-M, with particular genotypes associated with different geographical regions. The spread of these enzymes has compromised the clinical utility of a number of beta-lactam classes and with the spread of genes such as bla(KPC), carbapenems may be increasingly compromised in the future. High-level fluoroquinolone resistance (mainly caused by gyrA mutations) has also been shown to be associated with CTX-M and CMY-type enzymes, commonly due to co-carriage on conjugative plasmids of the gene for the aminoglycoside-inactivating enzyme AAC-6(1)-Ib-cr and qnr genes (which confer low-level resistance), allowing the easy selection of gyrA mutants in the host strain. Resistance in Gram-positive bacteria is also widely distributed and increasing, with the emergence of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) blurring the distinction between hospital and community strains. Antibiotic use and environmental factors all have a role in the emergence and spread of resistance. This article reviews some of the new mechanisms and recent trends in the global spread of MDR bacteria.},

The resistance elements found are similar to those commonly found in clinical isolates, like the transposon Tn1721 including the Tet A tetracycline resistance determinant, Tn10 with the Tet B determinant, Tn21 including a class 1 integron with the aadA1a cassette inserted, sulII encoding sulfonamide resistance, and the strA-strB genes responsible for streptomycin resistance. The plasmids were able to mobilize into various recipients, including swine pathogens, zoonotic bacteria, and commensals when conjugation experiments were carried out. Transfer of plasmids did not require optimal conditions concerning nutrition and temperature as plasmids were transferred in 0.9{\%} saline at room temperature, suggesting that in vivo transfer might be possible. This study shows that transferable resistance elements appearing in normal flora bacteria from animals are similar to those commonly found in clinical isolates of human origin. The results indicate a probable communication between pathogens and the normal flora with respect to exchange of resistance factors.},

QREC strains were more common in patients with nosocomial infections but also increased in patients with community-acquired infections (9{\%} in 1992 to 17{\%} in 1996). Seventy (12{\%}) of 572 episodes of E. coli bacteremia were due to QREC. Factors significantly associated with QREC bacteremia were the presence of underlying disease, recent exposure to antibiotics, and bacteremia of unknown origin. In the multivariate analysis, only prior exposure to antimicrobial agents (P {\textless} 0.001; odds ratio [OR] = 2), specifically, to quinolones (P {\textless} 0. 001; OR = 14), and the presence of a urinary catheter (P {\textless} 0.001; OR = 2) were significantly associated with QREC bacteremia. Among 16 QREC isolates from cultures of blood of community origin selected at random, 13 different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were recognized, showing the genetic diversity of these isolates and in turn indicating the independent emergence of QREC in the community. The prevalence of QREC in the feces of healthy people was unexpectedly high (24{\%} in adults and 26{\%} in children). A survey of the prevalence of QREC of avian and porcine origin revealed a very high proportion of QREC in animal feces (up to 90{\%} of chickens harbored QREC). The high prevalence of QREC in the stools of healthy humans in our area could be linked to the high prevalence of resistant isolates in poultry and pork.},

A new generic MLVA-assay was then developed with the capability of genotyping all E. coli serotypes. This generic E. coli MLVA (GECM7) was based on polymorphism in seven variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) loci. GECM7 worked well with the majority of E. coli serotypes; however we wanted to increase the resolution for this method based in part of comparison with PFGE typing of E. coli O26:H11, where PFGE appeared to display higher resolution. The GECM7 method was improved by adding three new repeat-loci to a total of ten (GECM10), and a considerable increase in resolution was observed (from 296 to 507 genotypes on the same set of strains).},

The structure of AmpC(D) suggests that the tripeptide deletion at positions 286-288 located in the H10 helix causes a structural change of the Asn289-Asn294 region from the alpha-helix present in the native AmpC beta-lactamase of E. coli to a loop structure, which results in a widening of the substrate-binding site.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance and mechanisms involved were studied in Escherichia coli isolates from fecal samples of healthy children. Fifty fecal samples were analyzed, and one colony per sample was recovered and identified by biochemical and molecular tests. Forty-one E. coli isolates were obtained (82{\%}). MIC testing was performed by agar dilution with 18 antibiotics, and the mechanisms of resistance were analyzed. Ampicillin resistance was detected in 24 isolates (58.5{\%}), and blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaOXA type genes were studied by PCR and sequencing. The following beta-lactamases were detected (number of isolates): TEM (20), SHV-1 (1), and OXA-30 (1). The number of aminoglycoside-resistant isolates detected was as follows: streptomycin (15), tobramycin (1), gentamicin (1), and kanamycin (4). The aac(3)-IV gene was detected in the only gentamicin-resistant isolate. Nine (22{\%}) and 2 (5{\%}) isolates showed nalidixic acid (NALR) and ciprofloxacin resistance (CIPR), respectively. Mutations in GyrA and ParC proteins were shown in both NAL(R)-CIP(R) isolates and were the following: (1) GyrA (S83L + D87N), ParC (S801); and (2) GyrA (S83L + A84P), ParC (S80I + A108V). A single mutation in the S83 codon of the gyrA gene was found in the remaining seven NAL(R)-CIP(S) isolates. Tetracycline resistance was identified in 21 isolates (51{\%}) and the following resistance genes were found (number of isolates): tetA (12), tetB (5), and tetD (1). Chloramphenicol resistance was detected in five isolates (12{\%}). These results show that the intestinal tract of healthy children constitutes a reservoir of resistant bacteria and resistance genes.},

abstract = {Extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichiacoli (ExPEC) have a complex phylogeny, broad virulence factor (VF) armament and significant genomic plasticity, and are associated with a spectrum of host infective syndromes ranging from simple urinary tract infection to life-threatening bacteraemia. Their importance as pathogens has come to the fore in recent years, particularly in the context of the global emergence of hyper-virulent and antibiotic resistant strains. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying ExPEC transmission dynamics and clonal selection remain poorly understood. Large-scale epidemiological and clinical studies are urgently required to ascertain the mechanisms underlying these processes to enable the development of novel evidence-based preventative and therapeutic strategies. In the current review, we provide a concise summary of the methods utilised for ExPEC phylogenetic delineation before exploring in detail the associations between ExPEC VFs and site-specific disease. We then consider the role of ExPEC as an intestinal colonist and outline known associations between ExPEC clonal variation, specific disease syndromes and antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {The biofilm-producing abilities of potentially human-pathogenic serotypes of Escherichia coli from the ovine reservoir were studied at different temperatures and on different surfaces. A possible influence of the hydrophobicity of the bacterial cells, as well as the presence of two virulence factors, the Shiga toxin-encoding (Stx) bacteriophage and the eae gene, was also studied. A total of 99 E. coli isolates of serotypes O26:H11, O103:H2, and O103:H25 isolated from sheep feces were included. The results show that isolates of all three E. coli serotypes investigated can produce biofilm on stainless steel, glass, and polystyrene at 12, 20, and 37 degrees C. There was a good general correlation between the results obtained on the different surfaces. E. coli O103:H2 isolates produced much more biofilm than those of the other two serotypes at all three temperatures. In addition, isolates of serotype O26:H11 produced more biofilm than those of O103:H25 at 37 degrees C. The hydrophobicity of the isolates varied between serotypes and was also influenced by temperature. The results strongly indicated that hydrophobicity influenced the attachment of the bacteria rather than their ability to form biofilm once attached. Isolates with the eae gene produced less biofilm at 37 degrees C than isolates without this gene. The presence of a Stx bacteriophage did not influence biofilm production. In conclusion, our results show that potentially human-pathogenic E. coli from the ovine reservoir can form biofilm on various surfaces and at several temperatures relevant for food production and handling.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to analyse the interplay among plasmid-mediated qnr genes, alone or in combination with multiple chromosomal-mediated fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance determinants, susceptibility to FQs and bacterial fitness in an isogenic Escherichia coli collection. METHODS E. coli ATCC 25922 was used to modify or delete chromosomal genes. qnr genes were cloned into the pBK-CMV vector. The MICs of FQs were determined by microdilution. Mutant prevention concentration and frequency of mutants were evaluated. Bacterial fitness was analysed using $\Delta$lacZ system competition assays using in vitro and in vivo models. RESULTS The relationships between the number of resistance mutawith chromosomal mutations. We identified susceptible triple mutants in which the acquisition of a fourth retions and bacterial fitness were complex. With specific combinations of resistance mechanisms the addition of a new resistance mutation was shown to improve bacterial fitness. qnrA1 caused a decrease in fitness (7{\%}-21{\%}) while qnrS1 caused an increase in fitness (9{\%}-21{\%}) when combined sistance mutation significantly increased fitness and at the same time reached the clinical resistance level (the acquisition of qnrS1 in a S83L + D87N + $\Delta$marR genetic background). A strong correlation with the production of reactive oxygen species, as well as changes in susceptibility, was observed following treatment with ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that there may be critical stages (depending on the genotype) in resistance development, including chromosomal- and plasmid-mediated mechanisms, at which some low-fitness mutants below the resistance breakpoint are able to evolve clinical resistance with just one or two mutations, and show increased fitness.},

abstract = {The investigation on antimicrobial mechanisms is a challenging and crucial issue in the fields of food or clinical microbiology, as it constitutes a prerequisite to the development of new antimicrobial processes or compounds, as well as to anticipate phenomenon of microbial resistance. Nowadays it is accepted that a cells population exposed to a stress can cause the appearance of different cell populations and in particular sub-lethally compromised cells which could be defined as viable but non culturable (VBNC). Recent advances on flow cytometry (FCM) and especially on multi-parameter flow cytometry (MP-FCM) provide the opportunity to obtain high-speed information at real time on damage at single-cell level. This review gathers MP-FCM methodologies based on individual and simultaneous staining of microbial cells employed to investigate their physiological state following different physical and chemical antimicrobial treatments. Special attention will be paid to recent studies exploiting the possibility to corroborate MP-FCM results with additional techniques (plate counting, microscopy, spectroscopy, molecular biology techniques, membrane modeling) in order to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of action of a given antimicrobial treatment or compound. The combination of MP-FCM methodologies with these additional methods is namely a promising and increasingly used approach to give further insight in differences in microbial sub-population evolutions in response to antimicrobial treatments.},

abstract = {Decoquinate is a quinolone coccidiostat introduced during 1967 as an in-feed prophylactic for broiler chickens. Despite early drug-resistance problems and its age, the drug is still used commercially worldwide. Decoquinate here serves as a valuable model in a field study that addresses the dynamics and economic impact of the development of coccidial resistance to potent synthetic anticoccidial drugs. The results of this unique, hitherto unpublished, study on the initial emergence of resistance of avian coccidia (Eimeria spp.) to a new drug in the field may be of strategic value in the continued use of decoquinate or the introduction of new drugs. The commercial performance of the first 3-5 crops of broilers to be medicated with decoquinate on each of six farms was monitored during 14 months in 1968-1969, supplemented by assessments of the species, population dynamics and decoquinate-resistance of coccidia isolated from each farm. During the rearing of each flock in a single shed on each farm, oocysts were counted in fresh faecal samples collected on three occasions, and the species were identified by their morphology if possible, supported if necessary by the biological characteristics of infections in chickens. E. acervulina was the most common species, followed by E. mitis, E. maxima, E. tenella and E. praecox. E. brunetti occurred rarely, and E. necatrix was not found. Decoquinate-resistance was evident in several species during the rearing of the first decoquinate-medicated crop on each farm, although clinical coccidiosis did not occur. It was concluded that inherently resistant mutants of E. acervulina, E. brunetti, E. maxima, E. tenella, and probably also E. mitis and E. praecox, were selected from field populations by 6 weeks during their first exposure to decoquinate. During up to four more subsequent crops, cycling of resistant parasites stimulated host immunity, which had no obvious adverse impact on commercial performance. There was no apparent seasonal effect. A hypothesis is proposed to explain the sudden and rapid emergence of quinolone-resistance in the coccidia, and why bird health was not thereby compromised in these circumstances. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Recombination causes frequent genome rearrangements, horizontal transfer introduces new sequences into bacterial chromosomes, and deletions remove segments of the genome. Consequently, each genome is a mosaic of unique lineage-specific segments, regions shared with a subset of other genomes and segments conserved among all the genomes under consideration. Furthermore, the linear order of these segments may be shuffled among genomes. We present methods for identification and alignment of conserved genomic DNA in the presence of rearrangements and horizontal transfer. Our methods have been implemented in a software package called Mauve. Mauve has been applied to align nine enterobacterial genomes and to determine global rearrangement structure in three mammalian genomes. We have evaluated the quality of Mauve alignments and drawn comparison to other methods through extensive simulations of genome evolution.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli usually produces only very small amounts of a constitutive AmpC beta-lactamase, but clinical strains overproducing this enzyme have been isolated. Three different ampC promoters of E. coli clinical strains were cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in the pKK232-8 reporter plasmid and their relative strengths were compared by two different methods. The strength of the promoters from AmpC hyperproducers was 70- to 120-fold higher than those from a low-level AmpC producer. One of the strong promoters, which differs from strain K12 at bases -88, -82, -42, -18, -1 and +58, was mutated to abolish the -42 mutation. This change resulted in a 43-fold decrease in CAT concentration. In another promoter, with eight different mutations at positions -88, -82, -32, -18, -1, +5, +24 and +58, the -32T--{\textgreater}A transversion, which created perfect homology with the -35 consensus sequence, was reverted; this led to a 13-fold decrease in CAT concentration. The -42 and -32 mutations play an important role in E. coli resistance to beta-lactams by increasing ampC transcription.},

@article{Liu2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Until now, polymyxin resistance has involved chromosomal mutations but has never been reported via horizontal gene transfer. During a routine surveillance project on antimicrobial resistance in commensal Escherichia coli from food animals in China, a major increase of colistin resistance was observed. When an E coli strain, SHP45, possessing colistin resistance that could be transferred to another strain, was isolated from a pig, we conducted further analysis of possible plasmid-mediated polymyxin resistance. Herein, we report the emergence of the first plasmid-mediated polymyxin resistance mechanism, MCR-1, in Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: The mcr-1 gene in E coli strain SHP45 was identified by whole plasmid sequencing and subcloning. MCR-1 mechanistic studies were done with sequence comparisons, homology modelling, and electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry. The prevalence of mcr-1 was investigated in E coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains collected from five provinces between April, 2011, and November, 2014. The ability of MCR-1 to confer polymyxin resistance in vivo was examined in a murine thigh model. FINDINGS: Polymyxin resistance was shown to be singularly due to the plasmid-mediated mcr-1 gene. The plasmid carrying mcr-1 was mobilised to an E coli recipient at a frequency of 10(-1) to 10(-3) cells per recipient cell by conjugation, and maintained in K pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In an in-vivo model, production of MCR-1 negated the efficacy of colistin. MCR-1 is a member of the phosphoethanolamine transferase enzyme family, with expression in E coli resulting in the addition of phosphoethanolamine to lipid A. We observed mcr-1 carriage in E coli isolates collected from 78 (15{\%}) of 523 samples of raw meat and 166 (21{\%}) of 804 animals during 2011-14, and 16 (1{\%}) of 1322 samples from inpatients with infection. INTERPRETATION: The emergence of MCR-1 heralds the breach of the last group of antibiotics, polymyxins, by plasmid-mediated resistance. Although currently confined to China, MCR-1 is likely to emulate other global resistance mechanisms such as NDM-1. Our findings emphasise the urgent need for coordinated global action in the fight against pan-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria.

Significant enrichment (or depletion) of genomic features is anticipated to be biologically important. Detection of genomic regions having enrichment of certain features and estimation of corresponding statistical significance rely on the expected null distribution generated by a permutation model. We discuss different genome-wide permutation approaches, present examples where the permutation strategy affects the null model and show that the confidence in estimating statistical significance of genome-wide enrichment might depend on the choice of the permutation approach. In those cases, where biologically relevant constraints are unclear, it is preferable to examine whether key conclusions are consistent, irrespective of the choice of the randomization strategy.},

abstract = {To gain more information on the genetic basis of the rapid increase in the number of isolates exhibiting non-wild type Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) for cefotaxime observed since 2003, beta-lactamase genes of 22 Salmonella enterica and 22 Escherichia coli isolates from broilers in 2006 showing this phenotype were characterized by miniaturized micro-array, PCR and DNA-sequencing. Presence and size of plasmids were determined by S1-digest pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and further characterized by PCR-based replicon typing. Transfer of resistance plasmids was tested by conjugation and transformation experiments. To link resistance genes and plasmid type, Southern blot hybridization experiments were conducted. In 42 isolates, five (bla(CTX-M-1), bla(CTX-M-2), bla(TEM-20), bla(TEM-52), bla(SHV-2)) different extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-genes and two (bla(ACC-1), bla(CMY-2)) AmpC-genes were present. Three of the detected ESBL-genes (bla(CTX-M-1), bla(TEM-52) and bla(CTX-M-2)) were located on similar types of plasmids (IncI1 and IncHI2/P) in both E. coli and Salmonella. Two other detected ESBL- and AmpC-genes bla(SHV-2) and bla(CMY-2) respectively (on IncK plasmids), were only found in E. coli, whereas the AmpC-gene bla(ACC-1) (on non-typable plasmids), and the ESBL-gene bla(TEM-20) (on IncI1 plasmids), were only detected in Salmonella. In two isolates, no ESBL- or AmpC-gene could be detected through these methods. The increase in the number of E. coli and S. enterica isolates from the gastro-intestinal tract of broilers exhibiting non-wild type MICs for cefotaxime is mainly due to an increase in IncI1 plasmids containing bla(CTX-M-1). The reason for the successful spread of this plasmid type in these species is not yet understood.},

The successful distribution of CTX-M enzymes mainly involves Escherichia coli causing systemic as well as urinary tract infections in patients worldwide. CTX-M expression is often associated with coresistance that critically reduces treatments options. The mobilization of bla(CTX-M) genes from their original chromosomal position in various Kluyvera species has been facilitated by mobile genetic elements such as ISEcp1 or ISCR1. Molecular epidemiological studies have revealed a thriving linkage of bla(CTX-M) genes to conjugative plasmids and successful bacterial clones. Multireplicon FII plasmids are shown to carry the most widely distributed bla(CTX-M-15) across continents, paving the way for bla(CTX-M-15) into different genetic lineages of E. coli. Dissemination of virulent clones ST131-O25:H4-B2 and ST405-O102:H6-D is now being described worldwide. Importantly, CTX-M-producing strains are uncovering their ability of long-term gastrointestinal colonization often associated with travel to high-prevalent areas. Thus, we are witnessing a global epidemic of bla(CTX-M)-encoding E. coli strains and plasmids, which require serious attention and efficient infection control measures.},

abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a great concern in the medical community, as well as food industry. Soy peptides were tested against bacterial biofilms for their antimicrobial activity. A high throughput drug screening assay was developed using microfluidic technology, RAMAN spectroscopy, and optical microscopy for rapid screening of antimicrobials and rapid identification of pathogens. Methods: Synthesized PGTAVFK and IKAFKEATKVDKVVVLWTA soy peptides were tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria monocytogenes using a microdilution assay. Microfluidic technology in combination with Surface Enhanced RAMAN Spectroscopy (SERS) and optical microscopy was used for rapid screening of soy peptides, pathogen identification, and to visualize the impact of selected peptides. Results: The PGTAVFK peptide did not significantly affect P. aeruginosa, although it had an inhibitory effect on L. monocytogenes above a concentration of 625 $\mu$M. IKAFKEATKVDKVVVLWTA was effective against both P. aeruginosa and L. monocytogenes above a concentration of 37.2 $\mu$M. High throughput drug screening assays were able to reduce the screening and bacterial detection time to 4 h. SERS spectra was used to distinguish the two bacterial species. Conclusions: PGTAVFK and IKAFKEATKVDKVVVLWTA soy peptides showed antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa and L. monocytogenes. Development of high throughput assays could streamline the drug screening and bacterial detection process. General significance: The results of this study show that the antimicrobial properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability of soy peptides could possibly make them an alternative to the ineffective antimicrobials and antibiotics currently used in the food and medical fields. High throughput drug screening assays could help hasten pre-clinical trials in the medical field.},

abstract = {Extended multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis of atypical Escherichia isolates was used to identify five novel phylogenetic clades (CI to CV) among isolates from environmental, human, and animal sources. Analysis of individual housekeeping loci showed that E. coli and its sister clade, CI, remain largely indistinguishable and represent nascent evolutionary lineages. Conversely, clades of similar age (CIII and CIV) were found to be phylogenetically distinct. When all Escherichia lineages (named and unnamed) were evaluated, we found evidence that Escherichia fergusonii has evolved at an accelerated rate compared to E. coli, CI, CIII, CIV, and CV, suggesting that this species is younger than estimated by the molecular clock method. Although the five novel clades were phylogenetically distinct, we were unable to identify a discriminating biochemical marker for all but one of them (CIII) with traditional phenotypic profiling. CIII had a statistically different phenotype from E. coli that resulted from the loss of sucrose and sorbitol fermentation and lysine utilization. The lack of phenotypic distinction has likely hindered the ability to differentiate these clades from typical E. coli, and so their ecological significance and importance for applied and clinical microbiology are yet to be determined. However, our sampling suggests that CIII, CIV, and CV represent environmentally adapted Escherichia lineages that may be more abundant outside the host gastrointestinal tract.},

abstract = {There are concerns that selection pressure from antibiotics in the environment may accelerate the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Nevertheless, there is currently no regulatory system that takes such risks into account. In part, this is due to limited knowledge of environmental concentrations that might exert selection for resistant bacteria. To experimentally determine minimal selective concentrations in complex microbial ecosystems for all antibiotics would involve considerable effort. In this work, our aim was to estimate upper boundaries for selective concentrations for all common antibiotics, based on the assumption that selective concentrations a priori need to be lower than those completely inhibiting growth. Data on Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were obtained for 111 antibiotics from the public EUCAST database. The 1{\%} lowest observed MICs were identified, and to compensate for limited species coverage, predicted lowest MICs adjusted for the number of tested species were extrapolated through modeling. Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNECs) for resistance selection were then assessed using an assessment factor of 10 to account for differences between MICs and minimal selective concentrations. The resulting PNECs ranged from 8. ng/L to 64. $\mu$g/L. Furthermore, the link between taxonomic similarity between species and lowest MIC was weak. This work provides estimated upper boundaries for selective concentrations (lowest MICs) and PNECs for resistance selection for all common antibiotics. In most cases, PNECs for selection of resistance were below available PNECs for ecotoxicological effects. The generated PNECs can guide implementation of compound-specific emission limits that take into account risks for resistance promotion.},

These datasets, of increasing size, often include examples of multiple different mechanisms of horizontal sequence transfer resulting in substantial alterations to prokaryotic chromosomes. The impact of these processes demands rapid and flexible approaches able to account for recombination when reconstructing isolates' recent diversification. Gubbins is an iterative algorithm that uses spatial scanning statistics to identify loci containing elevated densities of base substitutions suggestive of horizontal sequence transfer while concurrently constructing a maximum likelihood phylogeny based on the putative point mutations outside these regions of high sequence diversity. Simulations demonstrate the algorithm generates highly accurate reconstructions under realistically parameterized models of bacterial evolution, and achieves convergence in only a few hours on alignments of hundreds of bacterial genome sequences. Gubbins is appropriate for reconstructing the recent evolutionary history of a variety of haploid genotype alignments, as it makes no assumptions about the underlying mechanism of recombination.

abstract = {The epidemiology of an enrofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli clone was investigated during two separate outbreaks of colibacillosis in the Danish broiler production. In total five flocks were reported affected by the outbreaks. Recorded first-week mortalities were in the range of 1.7-12.7{\%}. The clone was first isolated from dead broilers and subsequently demonstrated in samples from associated hatchers and the parent flock with its embryonated eggs, suggesting a vertical transmission from the parents. The second outbreak involved two broiler flocks unrelated to the affected flocks from the first outbreak. However, the clone could not be demonstrated in the associated parent flock. Furthermore, samplings from grand-parent flocks were negative for the outbreak clone. The clonality was evaluated by plasmid profiling and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. None of the recognized virulence factors were demonstrated in the outbreak clone by microarray and PCR assay. The molecular background for the fluoroquinolone-resistance was investigated and point mutations in gyrA and parC leading to amino-acid substitutions in quinolone-resistance determining regions of GyrA and ParC were demonstrated. Vertical transmission of enrofloxacin-resistant E. coli from healthy parents resulting in high first-week mortality in the offspring illustrates the potential of the emergence and spreading of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria in animal husbandry, even though the use of fluoroquinolones is restricted.},

A total of 131 broiler farms (44 cases and 87 controls) were included in the study, and 1 flock from each farm was included in the statistical analyses. Data on farm and flock level were collected by means of a questionnaire designed for the present study. The relationship and strength of association between the presence of Campylobacter spp. in the broiler flocks and several factors were investigated by unconditional logistic regression. The following factors were found to be associated with an increased risk of testing positive for Campylobacter spp.: water from a private water source, swine holdings closer than 2 km, a specific slaughterhouse, a hired animal caretaker, transport personnel passing through the hygiene barrier when delivering day-old chickens, less than 9 d between depopulation and restocking, and multiple broiler houses on the farm.},

Sequences from the V3 region of the env gene were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from chromosomal DNA obtained from low passage virus cultures. The PCR products from 13 Ugandan isolates were cloned into a phagemid vector and sequenced. Many isolates contained divergent V3 loop sequences and adjacent regions: diversity was associated with codon deletions or duplications and with nucleotide substitutions, especially G----A transitions. Proviruses from some of the cultures showed extensive diversity within the V3 loop sequences but others were more homogeneous. The V3 loop apices were conserved in 6 of the Ugandan proviruses and these were very similar to the equivalent regions of several Zairean proviruses. The V3 loop apices of African isolates of HIV-1 are divergent from those of North American isolates. The possible biological consequences of this divergence are discussed.},

abstract = {Fluoroquinolones are antibacterial drugs that inhibit DNA Gyrase and Topoisomerase IV. These essential enzymes facilitate chromosome replication and RNA transcription by regulating chromosome supercoiling. High-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in E. coli requires the accumulation of multiple mutations, including those that alter target genes and genes regulating drug efflux. Previous studies have shown some drug-resistance mutations reduce bacterial fitness, leading to the selection of fitness-compensatory mutations. The impact of fluoroquinolone-resistance on bacterial fitness was analyzed in constructed isogenic strains carrying up to 5 resistance mutations. Some mutations significantly decreased bacterial fitness both in vitro and in vivo. We identified low-fitness triple-mutants where the acquisition of a fourth resistance mutation significantly increased fitness in vitro and in vivo while at the same time dramatically decreasing drug susceptibility. The largest effect occurred with the addition of a parC mutation (Topoisomerase IV) to a low-fitness strain carrying resistance mutations in gyrA (DNA Gyrase) and marR (drug efflux regulation). Increased fitness was accompanied by a significant change in the level of gyrA promoter activity as measured in an assay of DNA supercoiling. In selection and competition experiments made in the absence of drug, parC mutants that improved fitness and reduced susceptibility were selected. These data suggest that natural selection for improved growth in bacteria with low-level resistance to fluoroquinolones could in some cases select for further reductions in drug susceptibility. Thus, increased resistance to fluoroquinolones could be selected even in the absence of further exposure to the drug.},

abstract = {Pathogenic Escherichia coli cause over 160 million cases of dysentery and one million deaths per year, whereas non-pathogenic E. coli constitute part of the normal intestinal flora of healthy mammals and birds. The evolutionary pathways underlying this dichotomy in bacterial lifestyle were investigated by multilocus sequence typing of a global collection of isolates. Specific pathogen types [enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enteroinvasive E. coli, K1 and Shigella] have arisen independently and repeatedly in several lineages, whereas other lineages contain only few pathogens. Rates of evolution have accelerated in pathogenic lineages, culminating in highly virulent organisms whose genomic contents are altered frequently by increased rates of homologous recombination; thus, the evolution of virulence is linked to bacterial sex. This long-term pattern of evolution was observed in genes distributed throughout the genome, and thereby is the likely result of episodic selection for strains that can escape the host immune response.},

We characterize infections by E. coli with reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs) with the AmpC phenotype. Between January 2004 and March 2007, 121 E. coli isolates with the AmpC phenotype were collected (4.8{\%} of all the 2538 E. coli isolates with reduced susceptibility to 3GCs). These isolates were further characterized by clinical and molecular analysis. Plasmid-encoded ampC genes were detected in 46 (38{\%}) isolates (43 CMY-2); 75 isolates (62{\%}) had modifications in the chromosomal ampC promoter region (c-AmpC). CMY-2 producers belonged primarily to the more virulent phylogroup D (48.4{\%}), whereas most isolates of c-AmpC belonged to phylogroup A (56.4{\%}). Bacteremia and infections in children were more frequently produced by CMY-2 producers. CMY-2-producing phylogroup D E. coli belonged to 8 multilocus sequence typing types. Three CMY-2 producers belonged to O25b/ST131/B2 clone. Infections caused by E. coli with the AmpC phenotype may be spreading primarily because of CMY-2-producing phylogroup D isolates, although this enzyme was also detected in the O25b/ST131/B2 clone.},

abstract = {Quinolones are a large and widely consumed class of synthetic drugs. Expanded-spectrum quinolones, like ciprofloxacin are highly effective against Gram-negative bacteria, especially Escherichia coli. In E. coli the major target for quinolones is DNA gyrase. This enzyme is composed of two subunits, GyrA and GyrB encoding by gyrA and gyrB, respectively. Mutations in either of these genes cause quinolone resistance. Mutations in QRDR section of gyrA are more common in quinolone resistant clinical isolates. However, a mutation outside of this region was also reported. Thus, this study was aimed to provide more information on mutations sites in gyrA. For this purpose, spontaneous ciprofloxacin resistant mutants arisen in cultures of E. coli ATCC 25922 and MG1655 were isolated on LB agar containing ciprofloxacin. Next, the MICs of these clones were measured and the presence of mutation in gyrA was investigated. Results showed that the frequency of ciprofloxacin resistant mutants in cultures of E. coli strains was low. However, these mutants had different MICs, depending on the day of isolation. Most of ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants possess mutations in QRDR region and precisely at Ser-83. However, mutations outside of this region were also found at Tyr-50 and Ala-119. In conclusion, the presence of mutations at amino acids 50 and 119 suggests that in addition to QRDR section and Tyr-122, these sites are also essential for DNA gyrase activity.},

abstract = {Ready-to-eat (RTE) prepacked salads and fruit have been successfully marketed for the last decade in Switzerland and are increasingly important as a component of everyday diets. To determine whether extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are present in RTE salads, fresh-cut fruit, and sprouts on the Swiss market, samples of 238 mixed and unmixed RTE produce from a large production plant and 23 sprout samples from two sprout farms were analyzed. Further, four samples from the production plant's recycled wash water, which is used for crop irrigation, were analyzed. Twelve (5{\%}) of the 238 RTE products and one of the recycled wash water samples yielded ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Strain identification and PCR analysis of the blaESBL genes revealed Kluyvera ascorbata isolated from a tomato sample harboring a blaCTX-M-2-like gene; multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacter cloacae detected in a chives sample imported from Spain harboring the clinically important bla(CTX-M-15) gene; and 10 Serratia spp. isolated from mixed salads (bla(FONA-2) and bla(FONA-2)-like genes were found in 6 [60{\%}] and bla(FONA-4)-like and bla(FONA-5)-like genes were each found in 2 [20{\%}] of the isolates). The recycled wash water sample tested positive for one extraintestinal pathogenic MDR Escherichia coli B2:ST131 harboring bla(CTX-M-27) and for one MDR E. coli A:ST88 containing bla(CTX-M-3). None of the sprout samples tested positive for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Overall, the majority of the Enterobacteriaceae detected in Swiss RTE produce were environmental strains producing minor ESBLs. The detection of an isolate producing a clinically important ESBL in a single sample and of an international circulating pathogenic strain (B2:ST131) in recycled wash water highlights the importance of surveillance of fresh produce and of recycled wash water that will be reused for irrigation purposes.},

Recent studies showed that poultry meat and humans share identical Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase genes, plasmid types, and Escherichia coli strain types, suggesting that transmission from poultry meat to humans may occur. The aim of this study was to compare plasmid-encoded Ambler class C beta-lactamase (pAmpC) genes, their plasmids, and bacterial strain types between E. coli isolates from retail chicken meat and clinical isolates in the Netherlands. In total, 98 Dutch retail chicken meat samples and 479 third-generation cephalosporin non-susceptible human clinical E. coli isolates from the same period were screened for pAmpC production. Plasmid typing was performed using PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT). E coli strains were compared using Multi-Locus-Sequence-Typing (MLST). In 12 of 98 chicken meat samples (12{\%}), pAmpC producing E. coli were detected (all blaCMY-2). Of the 479 human E. coli, 25 (5.2{\%}) harboured pAmpC genes (blaCMY-2 n = 22, blaACT n = 2, blaMIR n = 1). PBRT showed that 91{\%} of poultry meat isolates harboured blaCMY-2 on an IncK plasmid, and 9{\%} on an IncI1 plasmid. Of the human blaCMY-2 producing isolates, 42{\%} also harboured blaCMY-2 on an IncK plasmid, and 47{\%} on an IncI1 plasmid. Thus, 68{\%} of human pAmpC producing E. coli have the same AmpC gene (blaCMY-2) and plasmid type (IncI1 or IncK) as found in poultry meat. MLST showed one cluster containing one human isolate and three meat isolates, with an IncK plasmid. These findings imply that a foodborne transmission route of blaCMY-2 harbouring plasmids cannot be excluded and that further evaluation is required.},

@article{Schwarz2014,
abstract = {In staphylococci and other Firmicutes, resistance to numerous classes of antimicrobial agents, which are commonly used in human and veterinary medicine, is mediated by genes that are associated with mobile genetic elements. The gene products of some of these antimicrobial resistance genes confer resistance to only specific members of a certain class of antimicrobial agents, whereas others confer resistance to the entire class or even to members of different classes of antimicrobial agents. The resistance mechanisms specified by the resistance genes fall into any of three major categories: active efflux, enzymatic inactivation, and modification/replacement/protection of the target sites of the antimicrobial agents. Among the mobile genetic elements that carry such resistance genes, plasmids play an important role as carriers of primarily plasmid-borne resistance genes, but also as vectors for nonconjugative and conjugative transposons that harbor resistance genes. Plasmids can be exchanged by horizontal gene transfer between members of the same species but also between bacteria belonging to different species and genera. Plasmids are highly flexible elements, and various mechanisms exist by which plasmids can recombine, form cointegrates, or become integrated in part or in toto into the chromosomal DNA or into other plasmids. As such, plasmids play a key role in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes within the gene pool to which staphylococci and other Firmicutes have access. This chapter is intended to provide an overview of the current knowledge of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance in staphylococci and other Firmicutes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In a previous study with a Salmonella typhimurium strain containing cloned ampC-ampR from Enterobacter cloacae, it was suggested that ampC expression must be kept at low levels by AmpR to maintain normal growth and virulent phenotype. The purpose of this study was to determine whether findings obtained with a laboratory model can be extended to a virulent clinical isolate of S. typhimurium expressing the plasmid-encoded bla(CMY-7). METHODS: Disc induction assays were carried out to investigate inducibility of bla(CMY-7). Primer extension and sequence analyses were carried out to map the transcriptional start site of bla(CMY-7) and determine the relative expression. Growth and invasion potential of Salmonella strains were monitored by optical density, viable counts and cell invasion assays. RESULTS: Sequence analysis confirmed the absence of ampR upstream of bla(CMY-7) therefore confirming the negative results observed using the disc induction assay. Primer extension analysis mapped the start site of bla(CMY-7) transcription within an ISEcp1-like element. The relative expression of bla(CMY-7) was approximately 965-fold higher than the expression of a wild-type Citrobacter freundii chromosomal ampC and approximately 4.1-fold higher than ampC expression from a derepressed mutant of C. freundii. Growth and the capacity to invade mammalian cells were not compromised for either the clinical isolate or the S. typhimurium transconjugant containing bla(CMY-7). However, a Salmonella transformant containing bla(CMY-7) exhibited a compromised phenotype with respect to growth and invasion of mammalian cells. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that the biological cost of high-level AmpC production can be compensated by plasmid-encoded factors and not by regulating ampC expression.},

abstract = {Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) have been involved in Crohn's disease (CD). Currently, AIEC are identified by time-consuming techniques based on in vitro infection of cell lines to determine their ability to adhere to and invade intestinal epithelial cells as well as to survive and replicate within macrophages. Our aim was to find signature sequences that can be used to identify the AIEC pathotype. Comparative genomics was performed between three E. coli strain pairs, each pair comprised one AIEC and one non-AIEC with identical pulsotype, sequence type and virulence gene carriage. Genetic differences were further analysed in 22 AIEC and 28 non-AIEC isolated from CD patients and controls. The strain pairs showed similar genome structures, and no gene was specific to AIEC. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms displayed different nucleotide distributions between AIEC and non-AIEC, and four correlated with increased adhesion and/or invasion indices. Here, we present a classification algorithm based on the identification of three allelic variants that can predict the AIEC phenotype with 84{\%} accuracy. Our study corroborates the absence of an AIEC-specific genetic marker distributed across all AIEC strains. Nonetheless, point mutations putatively involved in the AIEC phenotype can be used for the molecular identification of the AIEC pathotype.},

abstract = {In Escherichia coli, the MarA protein controls expression of multiple chromosomal genes affecting resistance to antibiotics and other environmental hazards. For a more-complete characterization of the mar regulon, duplicate macroarrays containing 4,290 open reading frames of the E. coli genome were hybridized to radiolabeled cDNA populations derived from mar-deleted and mar-expressing E. coli. Strains constitutively expressing MarA showed altered expression of more than 60 chromosomal genes: 76{\%} showed increased expression and 24{\%} showed decreased expression. Although some of the genes were already known to be MarA regulated, the majority were newly determined and belonged to a variety of functional groups. Some of the genes identified have been associated with iron transport and metabolism; other genes were previously known to be part of the soxRS regulon. Northern blot analysis of selected genes confirmed the results obtained with the macroarrays. The findings reveal that the mar locus mediates a global stress response involving one of the largest networks of genes described.},

abstract = {Fruiting body lectins have been proposed to act as effector proteins in the defense of fungi against parasites and predators. The Marasmius oreades agglutinin (MOA) is a Galalpha1,3Gal/GalNAc-specific lectin from the fairy ring mushroom that consists of an N-terminal ricin B-type lectin domain and a C-terminal dimerization domain. The latter domain shows structural similarity to catalytically active proteins, suggesting that, in addition to its carbohydrate-binding activity, MOA has an enzymatic function. Here, we demonstrate toxicity of MOA toward the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This toxicity depends on binding of MOA to glycosphingolipids of the worm via its lectin domain. We show further that MOA has cysteine protease activity and demonstrate a critical role of this catalytic function in MOA-mediated nematotoxicity. The proteolytic activity of MOA was dependent on high Ca(2+) concentrations and favored by slightly alkaline pH, suggesting that these conditions trigger activation of the toxin at the target location. Our results suggest that MOA is a fungal toxin with intriguing similarities to bacterial binary toxins and has a protective function against fungivorous soil nematodes.},

abstract = {To combat the threat to human health and biosecurity from antimicrobial resistance, an understanding of its mechanisms and drivers is needed. Emergence of antimicrobial resistance in microorganisms is a natural phenomenon, yet antimicrobial resistance selection has been driven by antimicrobial exposure in health care, agriculture, and the environment. Onward transmission is affected by standards of infection control, sanitation, access to clean water, access to assured quality antimicrobials and diagnostics, travel, and migration. Strategies to reduce antimicrobial resistance by removing antimicrobial selective pressure alone rely upon resistance imparting a fitness cost, an effect not always apparent. Minimising resistance should therefore be considered comprehensively, by resistance mechanism, microorganism, antimicrobial drug, host, and context; parallel to new drug discovery, broad ranging, multidisciplinary research is needed across these five levels, interlinked across the health-care, agriculture, and environment sectors. Intelligent, integrated approaches, mindful of potential unintended results, are needed to ensure sustained, worldwide access to effective antimicrobials.},

abstract = {Broad-spectrum beta-lactamase genes (coding for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and AmpC beta-lactamases) have been frequently demonstrated in the microbiota of food-producing animals. This may pose a human health hazard as these genes may be present in zoonotic bacteria, which would cause a direct problem. They can also be present in commensals, which may act as a reservoir of resistance genes for pathogens causing disease both in humans and in animals. Broad-spectrum beta-lactamase genes are frequently located on mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids, transposons and integrons, which often also carry additional resistance genes. This could limit treatment options for infections caused by broad-spectrum beta-lactam-resistant microorganisms. This review addresses the growing burden of broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance among Enterobacteriaceae isolated from food, companion and wild animals worldwide. To explore the human health hazard, the diversity of broad-spectrum beta-lactamases among Enterobacteriaceae derived from animals is compared with respect to their presence in human bacteria. Furthermore, the possibilities of the exchange of genes encoding broad-spectrum beta-lactamases - including the exchange of the transposons and plasmids that serve as vehicles for these genes - between different ecosystems (human and animal) are discussed.},

RESULTS: The 59,228 bp sequence included a typical IncN-like backbone and a mosaic structure with blaVIM-1, aacA4, aphA15, aadA1, catB2, qnrS1, sul1, and dfrA14 conferring resistance to carbapenems and other beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, quinolones, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim, respectively. Most of these resistance genes were inserted in a class 1 integron that was embedded in a novel Tn3-like composite transposon. CONCLUSIONS: IncN plasmids carrying carbapenemases are frequently isolated from K. pneumoniae strains in clinical settings. The dissemination of K. pneumoniae harboring blaVIM-1 in surface water is a cause for increased concern to public health.},

Plasmid analysis included S1-nuclease-PFGE, polymerase chain reaction-based replicon typing, plasmid transfer and multidrug resistance profiling. Bla(CTX-M-15) (n=23; 51{\%}) and bla(CTX-M-14) (n=11; 24{\%}) were the major alleles of which 18 (78{\%}) and 6 (55{\%}), respectively, were linked to ISEcp1. Thirty-two isolates were of phylogenetic groups B2 and D. Isolates were of 29 different XbaI-PFGE-types including six regional clusters. Twenty-three different O:H serotypes were found, dominated by O25:H4 (n=9, 20{\%}) and O102:H6 (n=9, 20{\%}). Nineteen different STs were identified, where ST131 (n=9, 20{\%}) and ST964 (n=7, 16{\%}) were dominant.

Thirty-nine isolates (87{\%}) displayed co-resistance to other classes of antibiotics. A transferable CTX-M phenotype was observed in 9/14 isolates. This study reveals that the majority of CTX-M-15-expressing strains in Norway are part of the global spread of multidrug-resistant ST131 and ST-complex 405, associated with ISEcp1 on transferrable IncFII plasmids.},

abstract = {Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is caused by Leishmania infantum, an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite, endemic in U.S. hunting dog populations. CanL has been found in dogs in 28 states and two Canadian provinces. Previous studies by our group, (Boggiatto et al., 2011), demonstrated that vertical transmission of Leishmania was the predominant means of transmission within U.S. dogs. Very little is known regarding how this alternative means of transmission, alters the long-term immunity and clinical presentation of leishmaniosis in dogs born to a positive bitch. This study follows the immunological progression of CanL in three pups after birth to an infected bitch. During the course of the study, these dogs were tested every six months over the course of six years. Both immunologic (IFN-gamma, T cell proliferation, antibody production) and parasitological parameters (qPCR) of vertically-infected dogs were measured. Within the six years after birth to an L. infantum-infected, oligosymptomatic bitch, all dogs had at least one L. infantum PCR-positive test. Interestingly, despite living in the same location for their entire lives and being full siblings, these pups demonstrate three different disease progression patterns of L. infantum infection. One dog progressed to oligosymptomatic disease, maintaining a positive titer and had intermittent positive PCR results. One asymptomatic dog had positive serological titers and demonstrated a robust CD4(+) immune response to infection. The third dog had a negligible response to L. infantum antigen and was healthy. This work demonstrates the biologic variability associated with vertically-transmitted infection similar to the variety of presentations observed during vector-borne leishmaniosis.},

We have focused on plasmids and their function as an accessory and/or adaptive gene pool. Studies of the extent of HGT in natural environments have identified certain hot spots, and many of these involve biofilms. Biofilms are uniquely suited for HGT, as they sustain high bacterial density and metabolic activity, even in the harshest environments. Single-cell detection of donor, recipient and transconjugant bacteria in various natural environments, combined with individual-based mathematical models, has provided a new platform for HGT studies.},

abstract = {Exposure of Salmonella enterica to sodium cholate, sodium deoxycholate, sodium chenodeoxycholate, sodium glycocholate, sodium taurocholate, or sodium glycochenodeoxycholate induces the SOS response, indicating that the DNA-damaging activity of bile resides in bile salts. Bile increases the frequency of GC --{\textgreater} AT transitions and induces the expression of genes belonging to the OxyR and SoxRS regulons, suggesting that bile salts may cause oxidative DNA damage. S. enterica mutants lacking both exonuclease III (XthA) and endonuclease IV (Nfo) are bile sensitive, indicating that S. enterica requires base excision repair (BER) to overcome DNA damage caused by bile salts. Bile resistance also requires DinB polymerase, suggesting the need of SOS-associated translesion DNA synthesis. Certain recombination functions are also required for bile resistance, and a key factor is the RecBCD enzyme. The extreme bile sensitivity of RecB-, RecC-, and RecA- RecD- mutants provides evidence that bile-induced damage may impair DNA replication.},

@article{Handel2015,
abstract = {The spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria worldwide presents a major health threat to human health care that results in therapy failure and increasing costs. The transfer of resistance conferring plasmids by conjugation is a major route by which resistance genes disseminate at the intra- and interspecies level. High similarities between resistance genes identified in foodborne and hospital-acquired pathogens suggest transmission of resistance conferring and transferrable mobile elements through the food chain, either as part of intact strains, or through transfer of plasmids from foodborne to human strains. To study the factors that affect the rate of plasmid transfer, the transmission of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) plasmid from a foodborne Escherichia coli strain to the beta-lactam sensitive E. coli MG1655 strain was documented as a function of simulated environmental factors. The foodborne E. coli isolate used as donor carried a CTX-M-1 harboring IncI1 plasmid that confers resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Cell density, energy availability and growth rate were identified as factors that affect plasmid transfer efficiency. Transfer rates were highest in the absence of the antibiotic, with almost every acceptor cell picking up the plasmid. Raising the antibiotic concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) resulted in reduced transfer rates, but also selected for the plasmid carrying donor and recombinant strains. Based on the mutational pattern of transconjugant cells, a common mechanism is proposed which compensates for fitness costs due to plasmid carriage by reducing other cell functions. Reducing potential fitness costs due to maintenance and expression of the plasmid could contribute to persistence of resistance genes in the environment even without antibiotic pressure. Taken together, the results identify factors that drive the spread and persistence of resistance conferring plasmids in natural isolates and shows how these can contribute to transmission of resistance genes through the food chain.},

abstract = {Chromosomal multiple-antibiotic-resistant (Mar) mutants of Escherichia coli, selected on agar containing low concentrations of tetracycline or chloramphenicol, were 6- to 18-fold less susceptible to the fluoroquinolones than were their wild-type E. coli K-12 or E. coli C parental strains. The frequency of emergence of such mutants was at least 1,000-fold higher than that of those selected by the fluoroquinolone norfloxacin directly. When Mar mutants, but not wild-type cells, were plated on norfloxacin, mutants resistant to high levels of norfloxacin (2 micrograms/ml) appeared at a relatively high (approximately 10(-7] frequency. In addition to decreased amounts of OmpF, Mar mutants had other outer membrane protein changes and were four- to eightfold less susceptible to fluoroquinolones than was an ompF::Tn5 mutant lacking only OmpF. Accumulation of [3H]norfloxacin was more than threefold lower in the Mar mutants than in wild-type cells and twofold lower than in the OmpF-deficient derivative. These differences were not attributable to a change in the endogenous active efflux system for norfloxacin in E. coli. Norfloxacin-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis was threefold lower in intact cells of a Mar mutant than in susceptible cells, but this difference was not seen in toluene-permeabilized cells. Insertion of Tn5 into marA (min 34.05 on the chromosome) led to a return of the wild-type patterns of norfloxacin accumulation, fluoroquinolone and other antimicrobial agent susceptibilities, and outer membrane protein profile, including partial restoration of OmpF. These findings together suggest that marA-dependent fluoroquinolone resistance is linked to decreased cell permeability, only part of which can be accounted for by the reduction in OmpF. Once mutated to marA, cells can achieve high levels of quinolone resistance at a relatively high frequency.},

Plasmids also harbour virulence factors and addiction systems, promoting their stability and maintenance in the bacterial host, in different environmental conditions.

abstract = {Wild rodents can be carriers of antimicrobial resistant Escherichia coli. As rodents are known to be involved in the transmission of bacteria of human and animal health concern, they could likewise contribute to the dissemination of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in the environment. The aim of this study was therefore to get first insights into the antimicrobial resistance status among E. coli isolated from wild small mammals in rural areas. We tested 188 faecal isolates from eight rodent and one shrew species originating from Germany. Preselected resistant isolates were screened by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing or agar diffusion test and subsequent PCR analysis of resistance genes. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistant isolates was low with only 5.5{\%} of the isolates exhibiting resistant phenotypes against at least one antimicrobial compound including beta-lactams, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides and sulfonamides. These results suggest a minor role of wild rodents from rural areas in the cycle of transmission and spread of antimicrobial resistant E. coli into the environment. Nevertheless E. coli with multiple antimicrobial resistances were significantly more often detected in wildlife rodents originating from areas with high livestock density suggesting a possible transmission from livestock to wild rodents.},

abstract = {Biofilms are complex communities of microorganisms attached to surfaces or associated with interfaces. Despite the focus of modern microbiology research on pure culture, planktonic (free-swimming) bacteria, it is now widely recognized that most bacteria found in natural, clinical, and industrial settings persist in association with surfaces. Furthermore, these microbial communities are often composed of multiple species that interact with each other and their environment. The determination of biofilm architecture, particularly the spatial arrangement of microcolonies (clusters of cells) relative to one another, has profound implications for the function of these complex communities. Numerous new experimental approaches and methodologies have been developed in order to explore metabolic interactions, phylogenetic groupings, and competition among members of the biofilm. To complement this broad view of biofilm ecology, individual organisms have been studied using molecular genetics in order to identify the genes required for biofilm development and to dissect the regulatory pathways that control the plankton-to-biofilm transition. These molecular genetic studies have led to the emergence of the concept of biofilm formation as a novel system for the study of bacterial development. The recent explosion in the field of biofilm research has led to exciting progress in the development of new technologies for studying these communities, advanced our understanding of the ecological significance of surface-attached bacteria, and provided new insights into the molecular genetic basis of biofilm development.},

abstract = {Mar (multiple antibiotic resistant) mutants of Escherichia coli express chromosomally mediated resistance to a variety of structurally unrelated hydrophilic and hydrophobic antibiotics. Insertion of transposon Tn5 into the marA locus at min 34.05 on the chromosome completely reverses the Mar phenotype (A. M. George and S. B. Levy, J. Bacteriol. 155:531-540, 1983). We found that among changes in the outer membrane of Mar mutants, porin OmpF was greatly reduced, although Mar mutants were more resistant than cells lacking only OmpF. Transduction of the marA region from a Mar strain, but not a wild-type strain, led to loss of OmpF. P1 transduction of marA::Tn5 into a Mar mutant partially restored OmpF levels. Therefore, OmpF reduction required a mutation in the marA region. Mar mutants of an ompF-lacZ operon fusion strain expressed 50 to 75{\%} of the beta-galactosidase activity of the isogenic non-Mar parental strain, while Mar mutants of a protein fusion strain expressed less than 10{\%} of the enzyme activity in the non-Mar strain. These changes were completely reversed by insertion of marA::Tn5. The responsiveness of OmpF-LacZ to osmolarity and temperature changes was similar in Mar and wild-type strains. Although some transcriptional control may have been present, OmpF reduction appeared to occur primarily by a posttranscriptional mechanism. The steady-state levels of ompF mRNA were twofold lower and the mRNA was five times less stable in the Mar mutant than in the wild-type strain. Expression of micF, which lowers ompF mRNA levels, was elevated in Mar strains, as revealed by a micF-lacZ fusion. Studies with strains deleted for the micF locus showed that the marA-dependent reduction of OmpF required an intact micF locus. Our findings suggest that the marA locus directly or indirectly increases micF expression, causing a posttranscriptional decrease in ompF mRNA and reduced amounts of OmpF.},

abstract = {When avoparcin was prohibited for use as feed additive in poultry in Norway on 31 May 1995, an increased incidence of Clostridium perfringens-associated necrotic enteritis (NE) and an increase in the use of antibacterial (AB) drug therapy in meat-type poultry was expected. The consumption of AB drugs for use against NE in poultry in the period 1990-2001 was investigated by use of sales statistics at the drug-wholesaler level. Defined daily dose (DDD) per kg live weight poultry was the unit of measurement for drug use (to correct for differences in the dosages). Sales figures of the AB drugs were converted to number of DDDpoultry sold for the numbers of broilers at risk (broilers were 97{\%} of the slaughter poultry). Estimated annual percentages of the broilers treated against NE increased abruptly after the avoparcin ban--but in 1996, this figure declined to the same level as before the ban and has remained at that low level since then. In November 1995, narasin was approved temporarily as an ionophore feed additive (IFA) in broilers. The usage patterns of IFAs in broilers were measured as the weight of feed to which an IFA was added per broiler chicken produced. In 1996-2001, the IFAs used in broilers were predominantly narasin. We note that the temporary increase in NE after the avoparcin ban coincide with the period before narasin became available. The increase in the consumption of AB drugs for the treatment of NE in poultry following the avoparcin ban has been negligible.},

abstract = {Quinolones are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of antibacterials in the world and are used to treat a variety of bacterial infections in humans. Because of the wide use (and overuse) of these drugs, the number of quinolone-resistant bacterial strains has been growing steadily since the 1990s. As is the case with other antibacterial agents, the rise in quinolone resistance threatens the clinical utility of this important drug class. Quinolones act by converting their targets, gyrase and topoisomerase IV, into toxic enzymes that fragment the bacterial chromosome. This review describes the development of the quinolones as antibacterials, the structure and function of gyrase and topoisomerase IV, and the mechanistic basis for quinolone action against their enzyme targets. It will then discuss the following three mechanisms that decrease the sensitivity of bacterial cells to quinolones. Target-mediated resistance is the most common and clinically significant form of resistance. It is caused by specific mutations in gyrase and topoisomerase IV that weaken interactions between quinolones and these enzymes. Plasmid-mediated resistance results from extrachromosomal elements that encode proteins that disrupt quinolone-enzyme interactions, alter drug metabolism, or increase quinolone efflux. Chromosome-mediated resistance results from the underexpression of porins or the overexpression of cellular efflux pumps, both of which decrease cellular concentrations of quinolones. Finally, this review will discuss recent advancements in our understanding of how quinolones interact with gyrase and topoisomerase IV and how mutations in these enzymes cause resistance. These last findings suggest approaches to designing new drugs that display improved activity against resistant strains.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance and the mechanisms implicated were studied in 54 enterococci recovered from 57 seagull fecal samples. Almost 78{\%} of the recovered enterococci showed resistance against one or more antibiotics and these isolates were identified to the species level. E. faecium was the most prevalent species (52.4{\%}). High percentages of erythromycin and tetracycline resistances were found among our isolates (95.2{\%}), and lower percentages were identified to other antibiotics. Most of the tetracycline-resistant strains carried the tet(M) and/or tet(L) genes. Genes associated with Tn916/Tn1545 and/or Tn5397 transposons were detected in 45{\%} of tetracycline-resistant isolates. The erm(B) gene was detected in 65{\%} of erythromycin-resistant isolates. The vat(D) and vat(E) genes were present in 5.9{\%} and 11.8{\%} of quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant isolates, respectively. The ant(6)-Ia gene was identified in 57.1{\%} of streptomycin-resistant isolates. All nine kanamycin-resistant isolates carried the aph(3)'-IIIa gene. The cat(A) gene was found in two chloramphenicol-resistant isolates. Seagulls should be considered a risk species for spreading in the environment antimicrobial resistant enterococci and can serve as a sentinel for antibiotic pressure from the surrounding farm and urban setting.},

abstract = {Since quinolones are synthetic antibiotics, it was predicted that mutations in target genes would be the only mechanism through which resistance could be acquired, because there will not be quinolone-resistance genes in nature. Contrary to this prediction, a variety of elements ranging from efflux pumps, target-protecting proteins, and even quinolone-modifying enzymes have been shown to contribute to quinolone resistance. The finding of some of these elements in plasmids indicates that quinolone resistance can be transferable. As a result, there has been a developing interest on the reservoirs for quinolone-resistance genes and on the potential risks associated with the use of these antibiotics in non-clinical environments. As a matter of fact, plasmid-encoded, quinolone-resistance qnr genes originated in the chromosome of aquatic bacteria. Thus the use of quinolones in fish-farming might constitute a risk for the emergence of resistance. Failure to predict the development of quinolone resistance reinforces the need of taking into consideration the wide plasticity of biological systems for future predictions. This plasticity allows pathogens to deal with toxic compounds, including those with a synthetic origin as quinolones.},

The aim of this study was to screen for the presence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in human carriers in community settings in Switzerland, a country representative of central Europe. FINDINGS: Three hundred and fourteen stool samples of healthy staff members of a meat-processing company and 291 fecal swabs from primary care patients were recovered in Switzerland between April 2012 and July 2012 and were tested for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates by selecting for growth on a carbapenem-containing selective medium. Six resulting isolates (5 Escherichia coli and 1 Citrobacter youngae) were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests and PCR analysis by screening for the carbapenemase genes bla OXA-48, bla VIM, bla NDM-1, and bla KPC as well as for the extended-spectrum ss-lactamase genes bla TEM, bla SHV, bla CTX-M and bla CMY-2. No carbapenemase genes were detected. Resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics was due to carriage of the extended-spectrum ss-lactamase CTX-M-15 in 4 isolates, to CTX-M-14 in one further isolate and to the plasmidic AmpC-ss-lactamase CMY-2 in one isolate. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are as yet not present in the community. Continuous surveillance is necessary to anticipate future trends in the prevalence and dissemination of carbapenem resistant isolates in the population.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli is one of the most-studied microorganisms worldwide but its characteristics are continually changing. Extraintestinal E. coli infections, such as urinary tract infections and neonatal sepsis, represent a huge public health problem. They are caused mainly by specialized extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains that can innocuously colonize human hosts but can also cause disease upon entering a normally sterile body site. The virulence capability of such strains is determined by a combination of distinctive accessory traits, called virulence factors, in conjunction with their distinctive phylogenetic background. It is conceivable that by developing interventions against the most successful ExPEC lineages or their key virulence/colonization factors the associated burden of disease and health care costs could foreseeably be reduced in the future. On the other hand, one important problem worldwide is the increase of antimicrobial resistance shown by bacteria. As underscored in the last WHO global report, within a wide range of infectious agents including E. coli, antimicrobial resistance has reached an extremely worrisome situation that 'threatens the achievements of modern medicine'. In the present review, an update of the knowledge about the pathogenicity, antimicrobial resistance and clinical aspects of this 'old friend' was presented.},

But up to one per cent of natural bacterial isolates are 'mutator' clones that have high mutation rates. We consider here whether high mutation rates might play an important role in adaptive evolution. Models of large, asexual, clonal populations adapting to a new environment show that strong mutator genes (such as those that increase mutation rates by 1,000-fold) can accelerate adaptation, even if the mutator gene remains at a very low frequency (for example, 10[-5]). Less potent mutators (10 to 100-fold increase) can become fixed in a fraction of finite populations. The parameters of the model have been set to values typical for Escherichia coli cultures, which behave in a manner similar to the model in long-term adaptation experiments.},

These elements appear to have a diversified set of characteristics including cell-to-cell contact using pili or cell aggregation, transfer of single-stranded or double-stranded DNA, low or high specificity of integration and serine or tyrosine recombinases. This has led to a highly heterogeneous nomenclature, including conjugative transposons, integrative 'plasmids', genomic islands and numerous unclassified elements. However, all these elements excise by site-specific recombination, transfer the resulting circular form by conjugation and integrate by recombination between a specific site of this circular form and a site in the genome of their host. Whereas replication of the circular form probably occurs during conjugation, this replication is not involved in the maintenance of the element. In this review, we show that these elements share very similar characteristics and, therefore, we propose to classify them as integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). These elements evolve by acquisition or exchanges of modules with various transferable elements including at least ICEs and plasmids. The ICEs are probably widespread among the bacteria.},

abstract = {The epidemiological importance of tracing plasmids conferring drug resistance prompted us to develop a PCR method based on replicons (inc/rep PCR) of the major plasmid incompatibility groups among Enterobacteriaceae. Eighteen pairs of primers were designed to perform 5 multiplex- and 3 simplex-PCRs, recognizing FIA, FIB, FIC, HI1, HI2, I1-Igamma, L/M, N, P, W, T, A/C, K, B/O, X, Y, F, and FIIA. The specificity of the method was tested on a collection of 61 reference plasmids and on 20 Salmonella enterica strains of different serotypes isolated in Italy. Results indicated that the inc/rep PCR method demonstrates high specificity and sensitivity in detecting replicons on reference plasmids and also revealed the presence of recurrent and common plasmids in epidemiologically unrelated Salmonella isolates of different serotypes. These results suggest that the method is potentially applicable to a large number of strains to trace the diffusion of specific multi-drug resistance plasmids in different environments.},

While the aadB and the arr-2 gene cassettes were identical to those previously described, the remaining cassettes were novel: (i) a novel nonenzymatic chloramphenicol resistance gene of the cmlA family, (ii) a qac allele encoding a member of the small multidrug resistance family of proteins, (iii) a cassette, aacA1b/orfG, which encodes a novel 6'-N-acetyltransferase, and (iv) a fused gene cassette, oxa10/aadA1, which is made of two cassettes previously described as single cassettes. In addition, oxa10 and aadA1 genes were expressed from their own promoter sequence present upstream of the oxa10 cassette. arr-2 coded for a protein that shared 54{\%} amino acid identity with the rifampin ADP-ribosylating transferase encoded by the arr-1 gene from Mycobacterium smegmatis DSM43756. While in M. smegmatis, the main inactivated compound was 23-ribosyl-rifampin, the inactivated antibiotic recovered from E. coli culture was 23-O-ADP-ribosyl-rifampin. The integrase gene of In53 was interrupted by an IS26 insertion sequence, which was also present in the 3' conserved segment. Thus, In53 is a truncated integron located on a composite transposon, named Tn2000, bounded by two IS26 elements in opposite orientations. Target site duplication at both ends of the transposon indicated that the integron likely was inserted into the plasmid through a transpositional process. This is the first description of an integron located on a composite transposon.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence and worldwide spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae is of great concern to public health services. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in fresh vegetables and spices imported from Asia to Switzerland. FINDINGS: Twenty-two different fresh vegetable samples were purchased in March 2015 from different retail shops specializing in Asian food. The vegetables included basil leaves, bergamont leaves, coriander, curry leaves, eggplant and okra (marrow). Samples had been imported from Thailand, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and India. After an initial enrichment-step, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from two carbapenem-containing selective media (SUPERCARBA II and Brilliance CRE Agar). Isolates were screened by PCR for the presence of bla KPC, bla NDM, bla OXA-48-like and bla VIM. An OXA-181-producing Klebsiella variicola was isolated in a coriander sample with origin Thailand/Vietnam. The bla OXA-181 gene was encoded in a 14'027 bp region flanked by two IS26-like elements on a 51-kb IncX3-type plasmid. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the international production and trade of fresh vegetables constitute a possible route for the spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The presence of carbapenemase-producing organisms in the food supply is alarming and an important food safety issue.},

abstract = {Therapeutic options for infections caused by gram-negative organisms expressing plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases are limited because these organisms are usually resistant to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, except for cefepime, cefpirome, and the carbapenems. These organisms are a major concern in nosocomial infections and should therefore be monitored in surveillance studies. Six families of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases have been identified, but no phenotypic test can differentiate among them, a fact which creates problems for surveillance and epidemiology studies. This report describes the development of a multiplex PCR for the purpose of identifying family-specific AmpC beta-lactamase genes within gram-negative pathogens. The PCR uses six sets of ampC-specific primers resulting in amplicons that range from 190 bp to 520 bp and that are easily distinguished by gel electrophoresis. ampC multiplex PCR differentiated the six plasmid-mediated ampC-specific families in organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Family-specific primers did not amplify genes from the other families of ampC genes. Furthermore, this PCR-based assay differentiated multiple genes within one reaction. In addition, WAVE technology, a high-pressure liquid chromatography-based separation system, was used as a way of decreasing analysis time and increasing the sensitivity of multiple-gene assays. In conclusion, a multiplex PCR technique was developed for identifying family-specific ampC genes responsible for AmpC beta-lactamase expression in organisms with or without a chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase gene.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli is familiar to biologists as a classical model system, ubiquitous in molecular biology laboratories around the world. Outside of the laboratory, E. coli strains exist as an almost universal component of the lower-gut flora of humans and animals. Although usually a commensal, E. coli has an alter ego as a pathogen, and is associated with diarrhoeal disease and extra-intestinal infections. The study of E. coli diversity predates the availability of molecular data, with strains initially distinguished by serotyping and metabolic profiling, and genomic diversity illustrated by DNA hybridisation. The quantitative study of E. coli diversity began with the application of multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE), and has progressed with the accumulation of nucleotide sequence data, from single genes through multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) to whole genome sequencing. Phylogenetic methods have shed light on the processes of genomic evolution in this extraordinarily diverse species, and revealed the origins of pathogenic E. coli strains, including members of the phylogenetically indistinguishable " genus" Shigella. In May and June 2011, an outbreak of haemorrhagic uraemic syndrome in Germany was linked to a strain of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O104:H4. Application of high-throughput sequencing technologies allowed the genome and origins of the outbreak strain to be characterised in real time as the outbreak was in progress. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Antibiotics have always been considered one of the wonder discoveries of the 20th century. This is true, but the real wonder is the rise of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, communities, and the environment concomitant with their use. The extraordinary genetic capacities of microbes have benefitted from man's overuse of antibiotics to exploit every source of resistance genes and every means of horizontal gene transmission to develop multiple mechanisms of resistance for each and every antibiotic introduced into practice clinically, agriculturally, or otherwise. This review presents the salient aspects of antibiotic resistance development over the past half-century, with the oft-restated conclusion that it is time to act. To achieve complete restitution of therapeutic applications of antibiotics, there is a need for more information on the role of environmental microbiomes in the rise of antibiotic resistance. In particular, creative approaches to the discovery of novel antibiotics and their expedited and controlled introduction to therapy are obligatory.},

abstract = {Milk proteins constitute a natural reservoir of bioactive peptides with physiological and/or antimicrobial properties, the release of which requires hydrolysis of the precursor molecules by digestive proteases or by fermentation with proteolytic micro-organisms. Depending on the digestive or microbial proteases used, an array of bioactive peptides would be released either from caseins or whey proteins, but only a small part of these peptides has so far been identified and characterised with respect to their antimicrobial activity. The antimicrobial peptides known thus far have proven to be potent inhibitors to the growth of a wide range of undesirable micro-organisms of health or spoilage significance. Nevertheless, previous research work has largely been oriented towards their possible application in medicine, which has hindered their high potential as food-grade biopreservatives and/or as supplements in functional foods. This review attempts to study the literature pertaining to antimicrobial peptides derived from major milk proteins (caseins, 03B1-lactalbumin and 03B2-lactoglobulin) upon hydrolysis either by digestive proteases or by fermentation with proteolytic lactic acid bacteria. Their possible application in the food industry and their mechanism of action will also be discussed. Reference antimicrobial peptides produced by living micro-organisms as innate immune defence components against microbial infections will occasionally be invoked for comparison purposes.},

Three families of qnr determinants (qnrA, B and S) have been described, but little is known about their expression and regulation. Two new determinants, qnrC and qnrD, have been found recently. Here, we describe the characterization of the qnrB2 promoter and the identification of a LexA-binding site in the promoter region of all qnrB alleles. LexA is the central regulator of the SOS response to DNA damage. We show that qnrB2 expression is regulated through the SOS response in a LexA/RecA-dependent manner, and that it can be induced by the quinolone ciprofloxacin, a known inducer of the SOS system. This is the first description of direct SOS-dependent regulation of an antibiotic-resistance mechanism in response to the antibiotic itself.},

Samples from all levels of the broiler production pyramid and retail chicken meat (fillets) were included (n=649). The occurrence of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli at the different production levels ranged from 8 to 43{\%}. All these isolates had an AmpC-phenotype, and the majority carried the blaCMY-2 gene. In addition, a few isolates with up-regulated chromosomal ampC were identified. The results show that Norway has a relatively high prevalence of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in the broiler production chain in spite of a very low consumption of antimicrobial agents. Cephalosporins have not been used in the Norwegian broiler production, and it has been hypothesised that import of breeding animals and hatching eggs may be the source of these resistant bacteria. We demonstrate that these bacteria are disseminated in the production pyramid despite the lack of selection pressure from antimicrobial agents. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Fifteen strains of Escherichia coli with MICs of ciprofloxacin (CIP) between 0.015 and 256 micrograms/ml were examined for the presence of mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region of the gyrA gene and in an analogous region of the parC gene. No mutation was found in a susceptible isolate (MIC of CIP, 0.015 microgram/ml). Four moderately resistant strains (MIC of CIP 0.06 to 4 micrograms/ml) carried one gyrA mutation affecting serine 83, but in only one strain was an additional parC mutation (Gly-78 to Asp) detected. All ten highly resistant strains examined (MIC of CIP, {\textgreater} 4 micrograms/ml) carried two gyrA mutations affecting residues serine 83 and aspartate 87, and at least one parC mutation. These parC mutations included alterations of serine 80 to arginine or isoleucine and glutamate 84 to glycine or lysine. The parC+ and two mutant alleles (parCI-80 and parCI-80,G-84) were inserted into the mobilizable vector pBP507. Transfer of a plasmid-coded parC+ allele into parC+ strains did not alter the susceptibilities towards ciprofloxacin or nalidixic acid, while a significant increase in susceptibility was detectable for parC mutants. This increase, however, did not restore wild-type susceptibility, whereas transfer of a plasmid-coded gyrA+ allele alone or in combination with parC+ did. These data are in agreement with the view that topoisomerase IV is a secondary, less sensitive target for quinolone action in Escherichia coli and that the development of high-level fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli requires at least one parC mutation in addition to the gyrA mutation(s).},

abstract = {Many different definitions for multidrug-resistant (MDR), extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pandrug-resistant (PDR) bacteria are being used in the medical literature to characterize the different patterns of resistance found in healthcare-associated, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. A group of international experts came together through a joint initiative by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to create a standardized international terminology with which to describe acquired resistance profiles in Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae (other than Salmonella and Shigella), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp., all bacteria often responsible for healthcare-associated infections and prone to multidrug resistance. Epidemiologically significant antimicrobial categories were constructed for each bacterium. Lists of antimicrobial categories proposed for antimicrobial susceptibility testing were created using documents and breakpoints from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). MDR was defined as acquired non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories, XDR was defined as non-susceptibility to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories (i.e. bacterial isolates remain susceptible to only one or two categories) and PDR was defined as non-susceptibility to all agents in all antimicrobial categories. To ensure correct application of these definitions, bacterial isolates should be tested against all or nearly all of the antimicrobial agents within the antimicrobial categories and selective reporting and suppression of results should be avoided.},

abstract = {The beta-lactamases are widely distributed in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They all inactivate penicillins and cephalosporins by opening the beta-lactam ring. Many varieties of the enzyme can be distinguished on the basis of their catalytic and molecular properties, but only amino acid sequence determination gives information upon which a molecular phylogeny can be based. The present evidence suggests that the beta-lactamases have a polyphyletic origin. All the beta-lactamases of currently known amino acid sequence belong to one homology group, here called class A enzymes. Class B consists of the mechanistically distinct Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase II, which preliminary partial sequence analysis suggests to be structurally unrelated to the class A enzymes. It is predicted that sequence analysis will show that further classes will need to be created to account for particular beta-lactamases of distinctive molecular and mechanistic properties.},

@article{Spratt2004,
abstract = {Isolates of bacterial species that are indistinguishable in genotype are assigned as a clone, with the implication that they are descended from the same recent ancestor. Clones are difficult to define with precision since bacteria are not truly asexual, and recombinational replacements result in diversification of the ancestral genotype of a clone, to produce a cluster of increasingly diverse genotypes (a clonal complex). The rate at which clonal diversification occurs depends on the extent of recombination, which varies among bacteria, so that some species have rather stable clones (e.g., Salmonella enterica), whereas in other species (e.g., Helicobacter pylori) clones may be so transient that they cannot readily be discerned. Clones and clonal complexes need to be assigned by indexing genetic variation that is selectively neutral, and currently this is best achieved using multilocus sequence typing. Some species of bacterial pathogens are very diverse, whereas others are genetically uniform, and some are, in essence, a single clone of a mother species that has been raised to species status due to the distinctiveness of the disease it causes (e.g., Yersinia pestis, Salmonella typhi, or Burkholderia mallei). The population structures of bacteria depend on the rate of recombination, and comparative measures of the extent of recombination during clonal diversification can be obtained from multilocus sequence typing data, as can measures of the longer-term impact of recombination. These studies show a wide range of recombination rates among bacterial species, and indicate that recombination in many bacteria has been sufficiently extensive that a reliable evolutionary history of the species cannot be inferred.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence and worldwide spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae is of great concern to public health services. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the community in Switzerland. FINDINGS: One thousand and eighty-six stool samples of healthy humans (staff members of a food-processing company which were screened for the occurrence of salmonellae) were collected in September 2014. After an initial enrichment-step, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from the carbapenem-containing selective medium SUPERCARBA II. Grown colonies from 11 samples were screened by PCR for the presence of bla KPC, bla NDM, bla OXA-48 and bla VIM. A single OXA-48-producing Escherichia coli was detected. Phylogenetic grouping and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that this strain belonged to D:ST38, a type which had been previously reported in the UK, France, Lebanon and Egypt. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that OXA-48-producing Enterobacteriaceae have started to spread into the community in Switzerland, and a continuous monitoring is necessary to better understand their dissemination in the human population as well as in animals and the environment.},

This resistance can be depicted as a stepwise process in which each step, represented by separate mutations, diminishes susceptibility on average 4- to 8-fold. The precise path followed in this stepwise process differs with the quinolone that selects resistance as well as the organism involved. At each step, the influence of each mutation on susceptibility to other quinolones not used in the selection process varies greatly, and a pattern of either cross-resistance or dichotomous resistance may be seen. From an understanding of the stepwise process by which resistance to the quinolones evolves, it is possible to use an 8-fold rule to predict which compounds may provide effective therapy for a given infection and be least likely to select for resistance.},

abstract = {Electrophoretic techniques were employed to study variation in chromosomal genes encoding enzymes and in the distribution of cryptic plasmids in the E. coli population of a human host over an 11-month period. Thirteen of the 15 enzymes studied were polymorphic, and mean genetic diversity per locus was 0.39. Among 550 clones isolated from fecal samples, protein electrophoresis revealed 53 distinct electrophoretic types (ETs). Most ETs appeared on only one or a few days and were considered transients, but two (ET-12 and ET-13) were observed many times over extended periods and represented residents. Complete turnover in the transient ETs in the population occurred in periods of from two weeks to a month. ETs appearing in one month showed no particular genetic similarity to those of the previous month. - All but 4 of the 53 ETs carried one or more "cryptic" plasmids with molecular weights ranging from 1 to 80 megadaltons. With few exceptions, the plasmid composition of each ET was unique. In the course of the 11-month sampling period, there were changes in the plasmid profiles of the resident strains ET-12 and ET-13, and also in the profile of a recurrent strain, ET-2, which was isolated on four days. Modification of the plasmid profile of ET-12 involved the sequential addition of relatively high molecular weight bands. For ET-2 and ET-13, the changes in the plasmid profiles were radical, suggesting invasions of new cell types rather than merely the addition and deletion of plasmids. - The results of this study provide three lines of evidence that recombination plays a minor role in the generation of genetic diversity in the E. coli population of a single host. (1) Several pairs of loci were in strong linkage disequilibrium; compared to a randomly generated array of genotypes, the sample of ETs contained an excess of pairs differing at one or two loci and too many pairs with highly distinctive combinations of electromorphs. (2) In most cases where pairs of ETs differed at a single locus and, therefore, could reasonably have been generated by phage- or plasmid-mobilized gene transfer, the plasmid profiles of the pair members were radically different and/or the potentially transmitted alleles were not present in other ETs in the population. (3) Although ET-12 was abundant, being represented by 252 of the 550 clones sampled, the electrophoretic type most similar to ET-12 different from it at six loci, and ET-12 carried two unique alleles. We conclude that most of the genetic diversity observed in this human host is a consequence of successive invasions of E. coli genotypes.},

abstract = {The emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria reflects both, a gradual, completely Darwinian evolution, which mostly yields slight decreases in antibiotic susceptibility, along with phenotypes that are not precisely characterized as "resistance"; and sudden changes, from full susceptibility to full resistance, which are driven by a vast array of horizontal gene transfer mechanisms. Antibiotics select for more than just antibiotic resistance (i.e., increased virulence and enhanced gene exchange abilities); and many non-antibiotic agents or conditions select for or maintain antibiotic resistance traits as a result of a complex network of underlying and often overlapping mechanisms. Thus, the development of new antibiotics and thoughtful, integrated anti-infective strategies is needed to address the immediate and long-term threat of antibiotic resistance. Since the biology of resistance is complex, these new drugs and strategies will not come from free-market forces, or from "incentives" for pharmaceutical companies.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter spp. are important human pathogens. Serious infections due to these organisms are usually treated with extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs). However, in the past two decades we have faced a rapid increasing of infections and colonization caused by ESC-resistant (ESC-R) isolates due to production of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBLs), plasmid-mediated AmpCs (pAmpCs) and/or carbapenemase enzymes. This situation limits drastically our therapeutic armamentarium and puts under peril the human health. Animals are considered as potential reservoirs of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative organisms. The massive and indiscriminate use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine has contributed to the selection of ESC-R E. coli, ESC-R Salmonella spp. and, to less extent, MDR Acinetobacter spp. among animals, food, and environment. This complex scenario is responsible for the expansion of these MDR organisms which may have life-threatening clinical significance. Nowadays, the prevalence of food-producing animals carrying ESC-R E. coli and ESC-R Salmonella (especially those producing CTX-M-type ESBLs and the CMY-2 pAmpC) has reached worryingly high values. More recently, the appearance of carbapenem-resistant isolates (i.e., VIM-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and NDM-1 or OXA-23-producing Acinetobacter spp.) in livestock has even drawn greater concerns. In this review, we describe the aspects related to the spread of the above MDR organisms among pigs, cattle, and poultry, focusing on epidemiology, molecular mechanisms of resistance, impact of antibiotic use, and strategies to contain the overall problem. The link and the impact of ESC-R organisms of livestock origin for the human scenario are also discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to evaluate the proficiency of Spanish laboratories with respect to accurate susceptibility testing and the detection and interpretation of quinolone resistance phenotypes in Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS Thirteen strains of Enterobacteriaceae were sent to 62 participating centres throughout Spain; strains harboured GyrA/ParC modifications, reduced permeability and/or plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes. The centres were requested to evaluate nalidixic acid and five quinolones, provide raw/interpreted clinical categories and to detect/infer resistance mechanisms. Consensus results from reference centres were used to assign minor, major and very major errors (mEs, MEs and VMEs, respectively). RESULTS Susceptibility testing in the participating centres was frequently performed using the MicroScan WalkAway, Vitek 2 and Wider systems (48{\%}, 30{\%} and 8{\%}, respectively). CLSI/EUCAST breakpoints were used in 71{\%}/29{\%} of the determinations. The percentage of VMEs for all quinolones was well below 2{\%}. Only ofloxacin and moxifloxacin showed higher values for raw VMEs (6.6{\%}), which decreased to 0{\%} and 2.9{\%}, respectively, in the interpreted VMEs. These errors were particularly associated with the CC-03 strain [qnrS2 + aac(6')-Ib-cr]. For MEs, percentages were always {\textless}10{\%}, except in the case of ofloxacin and nalidixic acid. There was a significantly higher percentage of all types of errors for strains whose MICs were at the border of clinical breakpoints. CONCLUSIONS The use of different breakpoints and methods, the complexity of mutation-driven and transferable resistance mechanisms and the absence of specific tests for detecting low-level resistance lead to high variability and represent a challenge to accuracy in susceptibility testing, particularly in strains with MICs on the border of clinical breakpoints.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli is a common cause of healthcare-associated urinary tract infection, and is frequently present in the urine of elderly people. Transmission of E. coli between individuals has been suggested, and individuals can be concurrently colonized with several types. Efficient typing methods are required to investigate these epidemiological relationships, and we have examined the applicability of multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). METHODS: Up to 20 E. coli isolates were sampled per individual from 30 elderly residents at 2 long-term care facilities, and typed using MLVA, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and PhenePlate (PhP). RESULTS: Thirty-one E. coli types were identified using MLVA, compared to 38 and 32 using PFGE and PhenePlate, respectively. All isolates were typeable using MLVA and PhenePlate, whereas PFGE failed to type isolates from 2 individuals. The Wallace 1 coefficient indicated a high probability that isolates of the same PFGE type were also of the same type according to the other 2 methods. However, the Wallace 2 coefficient indicated a low probability that isolates of the same PhP type would be classified as the same type by PFGE. Twenty-four of the MLVA types were uniquely restricted to single individuals, whilst 7 MLVA types were found in more than 1 individual. Colonization with more than 1 MLVA type was seen in 8 individuals. There was no evidence of specific institutional types at either of the 2 long-term care facilities. CONCLUSION: MLVA displays a high discriminatory power, and shows substantial potential with respect to epidemiological studies and infection control issues.},

abstract = {The genus Escherichia is composed of Escherichia albertii, E. fergusonii, five cryptic Escherichia clades and E. coli sensu stricto. Furthermore, the E. coli species can be divided into seven main phylogroups termed A, B1, B2, C, D, E and F. As specific lifestyles and/or hosts can be attributed to these species/phylogroups, their identification is meaningful for epidemiological studies. Classical phenotypic tests fail to identify non-sensu stricto E. coli as well as phylogroups. Clermont and colleagues have developed PCR assays that allow the identification of most of these species/phylogroups, the triplex/quadruplex PCR for E. coli phylogroup determination being the most popular. With the growing availability of whole genome sequences, we have developed the ClermonTyping method and its associated web-interface, the ClermonTyper, that allows a given strain sequence to be assigned to E. albertii, E. fergusonii, Escherichia clades IâV, E. coli sensu stricto as well as to the seven main E. coli phylogroups. The ClermonTyping is based on the concept of in vitro PCR assays and maintains the principles of ease of use and speed that prevailed during the development of the in vitro assays. This in silico approach shows 99.4 {\%} concordance with the in vitro PCR assays and 98.8 {\%} with the Mash genome-clustering tool. The very few discrepancies result from various errors occurring mainly from horizontal gene transfers or SNPs in the primers. We propose the ClermonTyper as a freely available resource to the scientific community at: http://clermontyping.iame-research.center/.},

abstract = {Phylogenetics has witnessed dramatic increases in the sizes of data matrices assembled to resolve branches of the tree of life, motivating the development of programs for fast, yet accurate, inference. For example, several different fast programs have been developed in the very popular maximum likelihood framework, including RAxML/ExaML, PhyML, IQ-TREE, and FastTree. Although these four programs are widely used, a systematic evaluation and comparison of their performance using empirical genome-scale data matrices has so far been lacking. To address this question, we evaluated these four programs on 19 empirical phylogenomic data sets from diverse animal, plant, and fungal lineages with respect to likelihood maximization, tree topology, and computational speed. For single-gene tree inference, we found that the more exhaustive and slower strategies (ten searches per alignment) outperformed faster strategies (one tree search per alignment) using RAxML, PhyML, or IQ-TREE. Interestingly, single-gene trees inferred by the three programs yielded comparable coalescent-based species tree estimations. For concatenation-based species tree inference, IQ-TREE consistently achieved the best-observed likelihoods for all data sets, and RAxML/ExaML was a close second. In contrast, PhyML often failed to complete concatenation-based analyses, whereas FastTree was the fastest but generated lower likelihood values and more dissimilar tree topologies in both types of analyses. Finally, data matrix properties, such as the number of taxa and the strength of phylogenetic signal, sometimes substantially influenced the relative performance of the programs. Our results provide real-world gene and species tree phylogenetic inference benchmarks to inform the design and execution of large-scale phylogenomic data analyses.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION A classification scheme for ?-lactamases based on functional characteristics is presented. Three major groups of enzymes are defined by their substrate and inhibitor profiles: group 1 cephalosporinases that are not well inhibited by clavulanic acid; group 2 penicillinases, cephalosporinases, and broad- spectrum ?-lactamases that are generally inhibited by active site-directed ?-lactamase inhibitors; and the group 3 metallo- ?-lactamases that hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems and that are poorly inhibited by almost all ?-lac- tam-containing molecules. Functional characteristics have been correlated with molecular structure in a dendrogram for those enzymes with known amino acid sequences. ?-Lactamases (EC 3.5.2.6) have been designated by the No- menclature Committee of the International Union of Bio- chemistry as ââenzymes hydrolysing amides, amidines and other CON bonds . . . separated on the basis of the substrate: . . . cyclic amides'' (323). These enzymes are the major cause of bacterial resistance to ?-lactam antibiotics and have been the subject of extensive microbiological, biochemical, and genetic investigations. Investigators have described more than 190 unique bacterial proteins with the ability to interact with the variety of ?-lactam-containing molecules that can serve as substrates or inhibitors (45, 46, 129, 184; this minireview). Because of the diversity of enzymatic characteristics of the ?-lactama- ses, many attempts have been made to categorize these en- zymes by using their biochemical attributes.},

abstract = {The depolymerase enzyme (DpoL1) encoded by the T7-like phage L1 efficiently degrades amylovoran, an important virulence factor and major component of the extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) of its host, the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Mass spectrometry analysis of hydrolysed EPS revealed that DpoL1 cleaves the galactose-containing backbone of amylovoran. The enzyme is most active at pH 6 and 50 degrees C, and features a modular architecture. Removal of 180 N-terminal amino acids was shown not to affect enzyme activity. The C-terminus harbours the hydrolase activity, while the N-terminal domain links the enzyme to the phage particle. Electron microscopy demonstrated that DpoL1-specific antibodies cross-link phage particles at their tails, either lateral or frontal, and immunogold staining confirmed that DpoL1 is located at the tail spikes. Exposure of high-level EPS-producing Er. amylovora strain CFBP1430 to recombinant DpoL1 dramatically increased sensitivity to the Dpo-negative phage Y2, which was not the case for EPS-negative mutants or low-level EPS-producing Er. amylovora. Our findings indicate that enhanced phage susceptibility is based on enzymatic removal of the EPS capsule, normally a physical barrier to Y2 infection, and that use of DpoL1 together with the broad host range, virulent phage Y2 represents an attractive combination for biocontrol of fire blight.},

PMQR determinants were present in 49 isolates (22.8{\%}), among which aac(6')-Ib-cr and qnrB1 predominated (85.7{\%} and 26.5{\%}, respectively). Mutations in gyrA and parC QRDRs were detected among 89.8{\%} of isolates (MICâ¥4mg/L). Changes in Ser-83, Ala-84 and Asp-87 in GyrA and Ser-80 and Glu-84 in ParC were detected. Five isolates with ciprofloxacin MICs in the range 1.5-16 mg/L were found to have unaltered QRDRs, with PMQR as the only fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance trait detected. The remaining 44 PMQR-positive isolates were found to carry altered QRDRs. Three substitutions (two in GyrA and one in ParC) were detected in 23 isolates, whilst 8 isolates carried four mutations (two in GyrA and two in ParC). One isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae with two amino acid substitutions in the ParC QRDR in the presence of aac(6')-Ib-cr and qnrB1 had a ciprofloxacin MIC of 16mg/L. The results presented here show that FQ resistance in these clinical Enterobacteriaceae is a complex interplay between PMQR determinants and mutations in gyrA and parC rather than a single stepwise accumulation of mutations in the gyrase and topoisomerase subunits. In addition, these results show the role of PMQR determinants in promoting QRDR mutations and the acquisition of high-level FQ resistance in clinical settings.},

abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the reason for the predicted pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern for the sequenced Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933 (EDL933) being different from that observed in practice, using the restriction enzyme Xba1. METHODS AND RESULTS: Primers were designed that flanked either side of each of the predicted Xba1 restriction sites, and the resultant PCR products were sequenced. No sequencing errors were found in the published genome. The distribution of dam methylation sites within the genome was investigated, and a new PFGE pattern was predicted by assuming that any Xba1 restriction site that coincided with a dam methylation site would not be cut. The estimated mean band sizes were obtained from six replicate gels. It was found that the observed and predicted PFGE patterns were in good agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The difference between the observed and the predicted PFGE patterns for EDL933, using Xba1, could be accounted for by assuming that the methylated restriction sites were not cut. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: PFGE is commonly used as a subtyping method. This study provides additional information about the basic technique that could enhance the interpretation of PFGE patterns in comparative studies of the E. coli isolates.},

abstract = {MarA, a transcriptional regulator in Escherichia coli, affects functions such as multiple-antibiotic resistance (Mar) and virulence. Usually an activator, MarA is a repressor of hdeAB and other acid resistance genes. We found that, in wild-type cells grown in LB medium at pH 7.0 or pH 5.5, repression of hdeAB by MarA occurred only in stationary phase and was reduced in the absence of H-NS and GadE, the main regulators of hdeAB. Moreover, repression of hdeAB by MarA was greater in the absence of GadX or Lrp in exponential phase at pH 7.0 and in the absence of GadW or RpoS in stationary phase at pH 5.5. In turn, MarA enhanced repression of hdeAB by H-NS and hindered activation by GadE in stationary phase and also reduced the activity of GadX, GadW, RpoS, and Lrp on hdeAB under some conditions. As a result of its direct and indirect effects, overexpression of MarA prevented most of the induction of hdeAB expression as cells entered stationary phase and made the cells sevenfold more sensitive to acid challenge at pH 2.5. These findings show that repression of hdeAB by MarA depends on pH, growth phase, and other regulators of hdeAB and is associated with reduced resistance to acid conditions.},

abstract = {The fluoroquinolones (FQ) are used in the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the development of resistance could limit their effectiveness. FQ resistance (FQ(R)) is a multistep process involving alterations in the type II topoisomerases and perhaps in the regulation of efflux pumps, but several of the steps remain unidentified. Recombinant plasmid pGADIV was selected from a genomic library of wild-type (WT), FQ-sensitive M. smegmatis by its ability to confer low-level resistance to sparfloxacin (SPX). In WT M. smegmatis, pGADIV increased the MICs of ciprofloxacin (CIP) by fourfold and of SPX by eightfold, and in M. bovis BCG it increased the MICs of both CIP and SPX by fourfold. It had no effect on the accumulation of (14)C-labeled CIP or SPX. The open reading frame responsible for the increase in FQ(R), mfpA, encodes a putative protein belonging to the family of pentapeptides, in which almost every fifth amino acid is either leucine or phenylalanine. Very similar proteins are also present in M. tuberculosis and M. avium. The MICs of CIP and SPX were lower for an M. smegmatis mutant strain lacking an intact mfpA gene than for the WT strain, suggesting that, by some unknown mechanism, the gene product plays a role in determining the innate level of FQ(R) in M. smegmatis.},

abstract = {Clinically relevant extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing multi-resistant Escherichia coli have been on the rise for years. Initially restricted to mostly a clinical context, recent findings prove their prevalence in extraclinical settings independent of the original occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in the environment. To get further insights into the complex ecology of potentially clinically relevant ESBL-producing E. coli, 24 isolates from wild birds in Berlin, Germany, and 40 ESBL-producing human clinical E. coli isolates were comparatively analyzed. Isolates of ST410 occurred in both sample groups (six). In addition, three ESBL-producing E. coli isolates of ST410 from environmental dog feces and one clinical dog isolate were included. All 10 isolates were clonally analyzed showing almost identical macrorestriction patterns. They were chosen for whole-genome sequencing revealing that the whole-genome content of these 10 E. coli isolates showed a very high genetic similarity, differing by low numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms only. This study gives initial evidence for a recent interspecies transmission of a new successful clone of ST410 E. coli between wildlife, humans, companion animals and the environment. The results underline the zoonotic potential of clinically relevant multi-resistant bacteria found in the environment as well as the mandatory nature of the 'One Health' approach.},

Fecal samples ( n = 1,073) from rooks wintering in the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Serbia, Spain, and Switzerland were examined. Resistant isolates obtained from selective cultivation were screened for ESBL, AmpC, and PMQR genes by PCR and sequencing. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing were performed to reveal their clonal relatedness. In total, from the 1,073 samples, 152 (14{\%}) cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates and 355 (33{\%}) E. coli isolates with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were found. Eighty-two (54{\%}) of these cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates carried the following ESBL genes: bla CTX-M-1 ( n = 39 isolates), bla CTX-M-15 ( n = 25), bla CTX-M-24 ( n = 4), bla TEM-52 ( n = 4), bla CTX-M-14 ( n = 2), bla CTX-M-55 ( n = 2), bla SHV-12 ( n = 2), bla CTX-M-8 ( n = 1), bla CTX-M-25 ( n = 1), bla CTX-M-28 ( n = 1), and an unspecified gene ( n = 1). Forty-seven (31{\%}) cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates carried the bla CMY-2 AmpC beta-lactamase gene. Sixty-two (17{\%}) of the E. coli isolates with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were positive for the PMQR genes qnrS1 ( n = 54), qnrB19 ( n = 4), qnrS1 and qnrB19 ( n = 2), qnrS2 ( n = 1), and aac(6â²)-Ib-cr ( n = 1). Eleven isolates from the Czech Republic ( n = 8) and Serbia ( n = 3) were identified to be CTX-M-15-producing E. coli clone B2-O25b-ST131 isolates. Ninety-one different sequence types (STs) among 191 ESBL-producing, AmpC-producing, and PMQR gene-positive E. coli isolates were determined, with ST58 ( n = 15), ST10 ( n = 14), and ST131 ( n = 12) predominating. The widespread occurrence of highly diverse ESBL- and AmpC-producing and PMQR gene-positive E. coli isolates, including the clinically important multiresistant ST69, ST95, ST117, ST131, and ST405 clones, was demonstrated in rooks wintering in various European countries.},

abstract = {We have previously observed high rates of acquired antibiotic resistance in commensal Escherichia coli from healthy children living in urban areas of Bolivia and Peru, including resistance to tetracycline and quinolones, which are not routinely used in childhood. In this work we investigated acquired resistance in commensal E. coli from healthy children and home-raised chickens in 12 households from one of the previously surveyed urban area in Bolivia, to ascertain the possibility of human-animal exchange of resistant strains in similar settings. The resistance rates to ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and trimethoprim-sulphametoxazole were overall high ({\textgreater}/=50{\%}) and comparable between children and chickens, whereas those to quinolones were significantly higher in chickens (81{\%} vs. 29{\%} for nalidixic acid; 43{\%} vs. 10{\%} for ciprofloxacin). Molecular characterization of tetracycline- and quinolone-resistant isolates (n = 66) from children and chickens of three selected households revealed a remarkable clonal diversity and, in some cases, the presence of the same resistant strains among children or among chickens living in the same household, but not between children and chickens. Several resistance plasmids were characterized, but inter-clonal plasmid dissemination was not detected. Overall, the results from the present study suggested that cross-transmission between children and home-raised chickens could not represent a major spreading mechanism for resistant E. coli in households of resource-limited settings with high human-animal promiscuity.},

abstract = {Multidrug resistance blaCMY-2 plasmids that confer resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins have been found in multiple bacterial species collected from different hosts worldwide. The widespread distribution of blaCMY-2 plasmids may be driven by antibiotic use that selects for the dissemination and persistence of these plasmids. Alternatively, these plasmids may persist and spread in bacterial populations in the absence of selection pressure if a balance exists among conjugative transfer, segregation loss during cell division, and fitness cost to the host. We conducted a series of experiments (both in vivo and in vitro) to study these mechanisms for three blaCMY-2 plasmids, peH4H, pAR060302, and pAM04528. Results of filter mating experiments showed that the conjugation efficiency of blaCMY-2 plasmids is variable, from {\textless}10(-7) for pAM04528 and peH4H to approximately 10(-3) for pAR060302. Neither peH4H nor pAM04528 was transferred from Escherichia coli strain DH10B, but peH4H was apparently mobilized by the coresident trimethoprim resistance-encoding plasmid pTmpR. Competition studies showed that carriage of blaCMY-2 plasmids imposed a measurable fitness cost on the host bacteria both in vitro (0.095 to 0.25) and in vivo (dairy calf model). Long-term passage experiments in the absence of antibiotics demonstrated that plasmids with limited antibiotic resistance phenotypes arose, but eventually drug-sensitive, plasmid-free clones dominated the populations. Given that plasmid decay or loss is inevitable, we infer that some level of selection is required for the long-term persistence of blaCMY-2 plasmids in bacterial populations.},

abstract = {Within the past 2 years, four separate groups have reported marked improvement in relapse-free survival when trastuzumab was added to adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. These results add further credence to the relevance of this receptor as a tumor target. Despite the significant benefits observed in early and advanced HER2-positive breast cancer, overexpression of the receptor is still associated with a poorer prognosis and an increased risk of disease relapse, even in patients with primary operable disease. Besides cytotoxic chemotherapy, and possibly hormonal therapy, patients whose tumors exhibit resistance to trastuzumab have few molecular-targeted options available. Recently, lapatinib, a small molecule dual inhibitor of both HER2 and EGF receptors, has been developed to expand the options for treating HER-positive breast cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quinolones are potent broad-spectrum bactericidal agents increasingly employed also in resource-limited countries. Resistance to quinolones is an increasing problem, known to be strongly associated with quinolone exposure. We report on the emergence of quinolone resistance in a very remote community in the Amazon forest, where quinolones have never been used and quinolone resistance was absent in 2002.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The community exhibited a considerable level of geographical isolation, limited contact with the exterior and minimal antibiotic use (not including quinolones). In December 2009, fecal carriage of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli was investigated in 120 of the 140 inhabitants, and in 48 animals reared in the community. All fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates were genotyped and characterized for the mechanisms of plasmid- and chromosomal-mediated quinolone resistance.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Despite the characteristics of the community remained substantially unchanged during the period 2002-2009, carriage of quinolone-resistant E. coli was found to be common in 2009 both in humans (45{\%} nalidixic acid, 14{\%} ciprofloxacin) and animals (54{\%} nalidixic acid, 23{\%} ciprofloxacin). Ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates of human and animal origin showed multidrug resistance phenotypes, a high level of genetic heterogeneity, and a combination of GyrA (Ser83Leu and Asp87Asn) and ParC (Ser80Ile) substitutions commonly observed in fluoroquinolone-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Remoteness and absence of antibiotic selective pressure did not protect the community from the remarkable emergence of quinolone resistance in E. coli. Introduction of the resistant strains from antibiotic-exposed settings is the most likely source, while persistence and dissemination in the absence of quinolone exposure is likely mostly related with poor sanitation. Interventions aimed at reducing the spreading of resistant isolates (by improving sanitation and water/food safety) are urgently needed to preserve the efficacy of quinolones in resource-limited countries, as control strategies based only on antibiotic restriction policies are unlikely to succeed in those settings.},

abstract = {To ascertain whether on animal farms there reside extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and plasmidic class C beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli isolates potentially pathogenic for humans, phylogenetic analyses, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing, serotyping, and virulence genotyping were performed for 86 isolates from poultry (57 isolates) and pig (29 isolates) farms. E. coli isolates from poultry farms carried genes encoding enzymes of the CTX-M-9 group as well as CMY-2, whereas those from pig farms mainly carried genes encoding CTX-M-1 enzymes. Poultry and pig isolates differed significantly in their phylogenetic group assignments, with phylogroup A predominating in pig isolates and phylogroup D predominating in avian isolates. Among the 86 farm isolates, 23 (26.7{\%}) carried two or more virulence genes typical of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). Of these, 20 were isolated from poultry farms and only 3 from pig farms. Ten of the 23 isolates belonged to the classic human ExPEC serotypes O2:H6, O2:HNM, O2:H7, O15:H1, and O25:H4. Despite the high diversity of serotypes and pulsotypes detected among the 86 farm isolates, 13 PFGE clusters were identified. Four of these clusters contained isolates with two or more virulence genes, and two clusters exhibited the classic human ExPEC serotypes O2:HNM (ST10) and O2:H6 (ST115). Although O2:HNM and O2:H6 isolates of human and animal origins differed with respect to their virulence genes and PFGE pulsotypes, the O2:HNM isolates from pigs showed the same sequence type (ST10) as those from humans. The single avian O15:H1 isolate was compared with human clinical isolates of this serotype. Although all were found to belong to phylogroup D and shared the same virulence gene profile, they differed in their sequence types (ST362-avian and ST393-human) and PFGE pulsotypes. Noteworthy was the detection, for the first time, in poultry farms of the clonal groups O25b:H4-ST131-B2, producing CTX-M-9, and O25a-ST648-D, producing CTX-M-32. The virulence genes and PFGE profiles of these two groups were very similar to those of clinical human isolates. While further studies are required to determine the true zoonotic potential of these clonal groups, our results emphasize the zoonotic risk posed especially by poultry farms, but also by pig farms, as reservoirs of ESBL- and CMY-2-encoding E. coli.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the clinical features of infections caused by Escherichia coli strains that produce plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase is limited. Of the several groups of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases, CMY-type beta-lactamase is the most common in the United States. METHODS: We prospectively identified patients infected or colonized with E. coli strains that produce CMY-type beta-lactamase, and we collected clinical data over a 7-month period. A retrospective cohort study was performed to identify features associated with these cases. Patients with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli were used as a control group. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, plasmid analysis, and phylogenetic typing were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with infection or colonization due to CMY-type beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and 25 patients with infection or colonization due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli were identified. The demographic characteristics of the patients were similar in both cohorts. Patients with CMY-type beta-lactamase-producing E. coli were significantly more likely to have symptomatic infection than were patients with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (P = .028). The CMY-type beta-lactamase was identified as CMY-2 or its variants. Ninety-four percent of the CMY-type beta-lactamase-producing isolates belonged to E. coli phylogenetic groups B2 and D, which are associated with virulence. Many of the isolates shared similar plasmid profiles, whereas the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles were diverse. Co-resistance to non-beta-lactam antimicrobials was common. CONCLUSION: In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, CMY-type beta-lactamase-producing E. coli strains are almost as common as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli strains, and they cause symptomatic infection in the majority of cases.},

abstract = {Fluoroquinolones are a widely used group of antimicrobials in both human and animal medicine, with ciprofloxacin being a critically important fluoroquinolone for serious human infections. The present study reports on a 1-year survey for the presence of ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli in turkeys from Great Britain. Boot swabs were taken from 442 turkey flocks comprised of 125 breeding flocks and 317 meat flocks from 337 different farms over a 1-year period (2006 to 2007). CHROMagar ECC containing 1 mg/l ciprofloxacin was used to obtain ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. Isolates were tested for sensitivity to 16 different antimicrobials. Isolates with ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations â¥8 mg/l were tested for mutations in gyrA by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Selected isolates were tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for qnrA, qnrB and qnrS, qepA and aac(6')-Ib-cr genes. Conjugations were performed to assess the transferability of resistance to quinolones. Ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli was found in 22.4{\%} of turkey breeding flocks and 60.9{\%} of meat flocks. Two main mutations in gyrA, as well as a range of silent mutations, were identified in resistant isolates. Flocks with transferable resistance genes qnrB, qnrS, and aac(6')-Ib-cr were found at a low flock prevalence of 4.2{\%}, 1.6{\%} and 1.0{\%}, respectively; however, under laboratory conditions only transfer of qnrS genes could be demonstrated. This work has confirmed the occurrence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli strains throughout turkey breeding and meat flocks, with almost one-third of E. coli isolates being resistant to ciprofloxacin. Of those, more than 87{\%} were also resistant to three or more antimicrobial classes.},

Four separate oligonucleotide probes, one each corresponding to the wild-type sequence, a mutation at codon 84 (nucleotide 251), a mutation at codon 85 (nucleotide 253), and mutations at both, were used to examine the total genomic DNA from each of the 30 isolates, which had been restricted, electrophoresed, and Southern blotted. The probes indicated that 15 of the 28 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates gave results consistent with a single mutation at codon 84. Four of the 28 ciprofloxacin-resistant strains had results consistent with a mutation at codon 84 and possibly at codon 85. The two ciprofloxacin-sensitive isolates from Tennessee showed homology with the wild-type probe sequence. Five isolates (4, Minnesota; 1, Tennessee) had no homology with any probe.

In a previous study, five outbreaks with a total of 21 isolates were examined by MLVA. Nearly 20{\%} of the epidemiologically linked strains were single-locus variants (SLV) of their respective predominant outbreak clone. This result prompted an investigation into the mutation rates of the seven MLVA loci (TR1 to TR7). With an outbreak strain that was an SLV at the TR1 locus of the predominant clone, parallel and serial batch culture experiments were performed. In a parallel experiment, none (0/384) of the strains analyzed had mutations at the seven MLVA loci. In contrast, in the two 5-day serial experiments, 4.3{\%} (41/960) of the strains analyzed had a significant variation in at least one of these loci (P {\textless} 0.001). The TR2 locus accounted for 85.3{\%} (35/41) of the mutations, with an average mutation rate of 3.5 x 10(-3); the mutations rates for TR1 and TR5 were 10-fold lower. Single additions accounted for 77.1{\%} (27/35) of the mutation events in TR2 and all (6/6) of the additions in TR1 and TR5. The remaining four loci had no slippage events detected. The mutation rates were locus specific and may impact the interpretation of MLVA data for epidemiologic investigations.},

Isolates clustered into 33 Sequence Types (STs) and 14 Sequence Type Complexes (STCs), and 58 MLVA-Types (MTs) and 25 different MLVA-Type Complexes (MTCs). A strong agreement between the MLST profile and MLVA typing results was observed, in which all ST131-isolates (n = 39) and most of the STC-648 (n = 10), STC-38 (n = 9), STC-10 (n = 9), STC-405 (n = 8) and STC-23 (n = 6) isolates were clustered distinctly into MTC-29, -36, -20, -14, -10 and -39, respectively. MLVA is a rapid and accurate tool for genotyping isolates of globally disseminated virulent multidrug resistant E. coli lineages, including ST131.},

This family is most common in cyanobacteria, suggesting a function related to cyanobacterial-specific metabolism. Although no experimental information is available for the structure of this family, it is predicted that the tandem pentapeptide repeats will form a right-handed beta-helical structure. A structural model of the pentapeptide repeats is presented.},

The expression of MfpA, a member of the pentapeptide repeat family of proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, causes resistance to ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin. This protein binds to DNA gyrase and inhibits its activity. Its three-dimensional structure reveals a fold, which we have named the right-handed quadrilateral beta helix, that exhibits size, shape, and electrostatic similarity to B-form DNA. This represents a form of DNA mimicry and explains both its inhibitory effect on DNA gyrase and fluoroquinolone resistance resulting from the protein's expression in vivo.},

abstract = {Two Escherichia coli isolates were recovered from the blood of two cancer patients and were demonstrated to produce high levels of the AmpC beta-lactamase with isoelectric points of {\textgreater}9.0. The hypertranscription of ampC RNA was observed by Northern blot hybridization in both isolates. One isolate (isolate EC44) had a point mutation (G--{\textgreater}A at position -28) and insertion of thymidine between positions -20 and -19 of the ampC promoter gene (GenBank accession no. AE000487). The single nucleotide insertion of T between positions -19 and -20 created an optimal distance (17 bp) in the Pribnow box for ampC hyperproduction. The other isolate (isolate EC38) had two point mutations (G--{\textgreater}A at position -28 and C--{\textgreater}T at position +58) and a 2-base (GT) insertion between positions -14 and -15. Although the insertion of GT between positions -14 and -15 may create a new promoter next to the original promoter, cloning of the ampC region with truncated nucleotides of the original -35 region of EC38 failed to verify the hypothesis that a new promoter would be created by such a nucleotide insertion. Instead, multiple start sites for ampC transcription at -1, +1, +2, and +3 were observed in an S1 nuclease protection assay. These results suggest that the RNA polymerase is flexible in the selection of a start site in ampC hypertranscription. In conclusion, nucleotide insertions between the -35 and -10 ampC promoter sequences was the mechanism for the hyperproduction of AmpC beta-lactamase and resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins. The failure of the two patients to respond to treatment with oxyimino-cephalosporins highlights the important role of such a resistance mechanism in the clinical setting.},

Nakajima, K. Kobayashi, M. Kobayashi, H. Asako, and R. Aono, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61:2302-2307, 1995). Most E. coli strains cannot grow in the presence of cyclohexane. We isolated the marRAB genes from a Kohara lambda phage clone and cyclohexane-tolerant mutant strain OST3408. We found a substitution of serine for arginine at position 73 in the coding region of marR of OST3408 and designated the gene marR08. Our genetic analysis revealed that marR08 is responsible for the cyclohexane-tolerant phenotype. We observed that the marA gene on high-copy-number plasmids increased the organic solvent tolerance of E. coli strains. Furthermore, exposure of E. coli cells to salicylate, which activates the mar regulon genes, also raised organic solvent tolerance. Overexpression of the marA, soxS, or robA gene increased resistance to numerous antibiotics but not to hydrophilic aminoglycosides.},

These strains with non-wild type MICs of â¥0.25 mg/L, for P. mirabilis â¥0.5 mg/L, were screened for PMQR determinants (qnr, oqxAB, qepA and aac(6â²)-Ib-cr), and for QRDR mutations in gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes. Among them, 20{\%} (32/160) carried at least one PMQR (18/32 qnrB, qnrS or qnrD, 10/32 aac(6â²)-Ib-cr and 13/32 oqxAB), and 80{\%} (128/160) no PMQR. qnrB was detected in 3 E. coli, 2 K. pneumoniae and 1 E. cloacae strains; qnrS in 6 E. coli and 1 P. mirabilis and aac(6â²)-Ib-cr in 4 E. coli, 5 K. pneumoniae and 1 E. cloacae strains. All qnrD1 were detected in P. mirabilis. oqxAB was detected in 12/14 K. pneumoniae and 1 E. cloacae. No qepA genes were detected. From the 32 PMQR-positive strains, 10 showed enrofloxacin MICs â¤2 mg/L and 22 MICs â¥8 mg/L, the latter carrying 1â4 mutations in QRDR. For the 128 non-PMQR strains, 37 showed enrofloxacin MICs â¤2 mg/L with 0â2 QRDR mutations, and 91 MICs â¥4 mg/L carrying 1â4 QRDR mutations. In conclusion, qnr was the major PMQR and qnrD only detected in Proteeae. Mutations in QRDR play a markedly greater role in mediating fluoroquinolone resistance than PMQR.},

All isolates were negative for known qnr genes (A, B, and S), aac(6')Ib-cr, and mutations in gyrA and parC. Plasmid DNA was extracted from all four isolates and transformed into Escherichia coli TG1 and DH10B cells by electroporation, and transformants were selected on 0.06 microg/ml ciprofloxacin containing brain heart infusion agar plates. Resistance to ciprofloxacin could be transferred by electroporation, and a similar 4,270-bp plasmid was found in all transformants. By sequence analysis, the plasmid was found to carry an open reading frame that had similarities to other qnr genes and that encoded a 214-amino-acid pentapeptide repeat protein. This gene, designated qnrD, showed 48{\%} similarity to qnrA1, 61{\%} similarity to qnrB1, and 41{\%} similarity to qnrS1. Further subcloning of the qnrD coding region into the constitutively expressed tetA gene of vector pBR322 showed that the gene conferred an increase in the MIC of ciprofloxacin by a factor of 32 (from an MIC of 0.002 to an MIC of 0.06 microg/ml). For comparison, qnrA1 and qnrS1 were also subcloned into pBR322 and transformed into DH10B cells, conferring MICs of 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis of all known qnr sequences was performed and showed that qnrD was more closely related to the qnrB variants but formed an independent cluster. To our knowledge, this is the first description of this qnrD gene.},

abstract = {Monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in commensal Escherichia coli (N = 3430) isolated from slaughtered broilers, laying hens, turkeys, swine, and cattle in Poland has been run between 2009 and 2012. Based on minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) microbiological resistance to each of 14 tested antimicrobials was found reaching the highest values for tetracycline (43.3{\%}), ampicillin (42.3{\%}), and ciprofloxacin (39.0{\%}) whereas the lowest for colistin (0.9{\%}), cephalosporins (3.6 Ã· 3.8{\%}), and florfenicol (3.8{\%}). The highest prevalence of resistance was noted in broiler and turkey isolates, whereas it was rare in cattle. That finding along with resistance patterns specific to isolation source might reflect antimicrobial consumption, usage preferences or management practices in specific animals. Regression analysis has identified changes in prevalence of microbiological resistance and shifts of MIC values. Critically important fluoroquinolone resistance was worrisome in poultry isolates, but did not change over the study period. The difference (4.7{\%}) between resistance to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid indicated the scale of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance. Cephalosporin resistance were found in less than 3.8{\%} of the isolates but an increasing trends were observed in poultry and MIC shift in the ones from cattle. Gentamycin resistance was also increasing in E. coli of turkey and cattle origin although prevalence of streptomycin resistance in laying hens decreased considerably. Simultaneously, decreasing MIC for phenicols observed in cattle and layers isolates as well as tetracycline values in E. coli from laying hens prove that antimicrobial resistance is multivariable phenomenon not only directly related to antimicrobial usage. Further studies should elucidate the scope of commensal E. coli as reservoirs of resistance genes, their spread and possible threats for human and animal health.},

abstract = {The ongoing change in the relationship between humans and companion animals is hallmarked by the increasing intensive care provided to companion animals in veterinary medicine, resulting in growing numbers of high-risk animal patients. The emergence of nosocomial infections in small animal clinics is one of the major drawbacks of this development, especially in terms of multidrug-resistance and potentially zoonotic pathogens. This mini-review therefore addresses recent findings regarding the increasing prevalence of multi-resistant bacterial pathogens like methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS), including Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) as well as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in companion animals. Along with the steady increase of nosocomial infection rates in veterinary clinics, particular attention has recently been drawn to the genetic background of multi-resistant strains, resulting in the identification of certain genetic lineages which frequently appear in both, human and animal samples. These sequence types (ST), included ST254, ST8 and ST22 in terms of MRSA and ST131, ST405 and ST648 for ESBL-producing E. coli. The interspecies distribution of these STs resulted in the assumption that certain extended-host spectrum genotypes (EHSG) might exist both for MRS and ESBL-producing E. coli. These initial findings underline the necessity to investigate the major molecular or functional driving forces facilitating interspecies transferability of such EHSG strains. Due to the zoonotic potential of these multi-resistant bacteria, another aspect of the changing social role of companion animals needs to be addressed: the close contact of pets with their owners, resulting in presumptive new transmission and infection routes. We therefore envision retaliatory actions like initial surveillance and monitoring programs not only in livestock, but also particularly in companion animals. Interdisciplinary approaches including human and veterinary experts should be implemented to develop reliable investigation procedures with respect to the current reality of animal owners and their pets. Additionally, consequent basic hygienic measures, prudent use of antimicrobials in companion animals and efforts regarding implementation of antibiotic stewardships should be fostered.},

Undistinguishable plasmids were identified in unrelated bacterial strains isolated at huge geographically distant area, with no apparent epidemiological links. These plasmids belong to families that are largely prevalent in naturally occurring bacteria, usually carry multiple physically linked genetic determinants, conferring resistance to different classes of antibiotics simultaneously. Plasmids also harbour virulence factors and addiction systems, promoting their stability and maintenance in the bacterial host, in different environmental conditions. The characteristics of the most successful plasmids that were at the origin of the spread of carbapenemase, expanded-spectrum beta-lactamase, and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes are discussed in this review.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare ESBL-producing Escherichia coli causing infections in humans with infecting or commensal isolates from animals and isolates from food of animal origin in terms of the strain types, the ESBL gene present and the plasmids that carry the respective ESBL genes. METHODS: A collection of 353 ESBL-positive E. coli isolates from the UK, the Netherlands and Germany were studied by MLST and ESBL genes were identified. Characterization of ESBL gene-carrying plasmids was performed using PCR-based replicon typing. Moreover, IncI1-Igamma and IncN plasmids were characterized by plasmid MLST. RESULTS: The ESBL-producing E. coli represented 158 different STs with ST131, ST10 and ST88 being the most common. Overall, blaCTX-M-1 was the most frequently detected ESBL gene, followed by blaCTX-M-15, which was the most common ESBL gene in the human isolates. The most common plasmid replicon type overall was IncI1-Igamma followed by multiple IncF replicons. CONCLUSIONS: ESBL genes were present in a wide variety of E. coli STs. IncI1-Igamma plasmids that carried the blaCTX-M-1 gene were widely disseminated amongst STs in isolates from animals and humans, whereas other plasmids and STs appeared to be more restricted to isolates from specific hosts.},

@article{Walton2017,
abstract = {Home range size is a fundamental concept for understanding animal dispersion and ecological needs, and it is one of the most commonly reported ecological attributes of free-ranging mammals. Previous studies indicate that red foxes Vulpes vulpes display great variability in home range size. Yet, there has been little consensus regarding the reasons why home range sizes of red foxes vary so extensively. In this study, we examine possible causes of variation in red fox home range sizes using data from 52 GPS collared red foxes from four study areas representing a gradient of landscape productivity and human landscape alteration in Norway and Sweden. Using 90{\%} Local Convex Hull home range estimates, we examined how red fox home range size varied in relation to latitude, elevation, vegetation zone, proportion of agricultural land and human settlement within a home range, and sex and age. We found considerable variation in red fox home range sizes, ranging between 0.95 km2 to 44 km2 (LoCoH 90{\%}) and 2.4 km2 to 358 km2 (MCP 100{\%}). Elevation, proportion of agricultural land and sex accounted for 50{\%} of the variation in home range size found amongst foxes, with elevation having the strongest effect. Red foxes residing in more productive landscapes (those in more southern vegetation zones), had home ranges approximately four times smaller than the home ranges of foxes in the northern boreal vegetation zone. Our results indicate that home range size was influenced by a productivity gradient at both the landscape (latitude) and the local (elevation) scale. The influence of the proportion of agriculture land on home range size of foxes illustrates how human landscape alteration can affect the space use and distribution of red foxes. Further, the variation in home range size found in this study demonstrates the plasticity of red foxes to respond to changing human landscape alteration as well as changes in landscape productivity, which may be contributing to red fox population increases and northern range expansions.},

Human blood cultures from these hospitals that contained ESBL genes were included. A high prevalence of ESBL genes was found in chicken meat (79.8{\%}). Genetic analysis showed that the predominant ESBL genes in chicken meat and human rectal swab specimens were identical. These genes were also frequently found in human blood culture isolates. Typing results of Escherichia coli strains showed a high degree of similarity with strains from meat and humans. These findings suggest that the abundant presence of ESBL genes in the food chain may have a profound effect on future treatment options for a wide range of infections caused by gram-negative bacteria.},

abstract = {In the last 10 years, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteria (ESBL-E) have become one of the main challenges for antibiotic treatment of enterobacterial infections, largely because of the current CTX-M enzyme pandemic. However, most studies have focused on hospitalized patients, though today it appears that the community is strongly affected as well. We therefore decided to devote our investigation to trends in ESBL-E fecal carriage rates and comprehensively reviewed data from studies conducted on healthy populations in various parts of the world. We show that (i) community ESBL-E fecal carriage, which was unknown before the turn of the millennium, has since increased significantly everywhere, with developing countries being the most affected; (ii) intercontinental travel may have emphasized and globalized the issue; and (iii) CTX-M enzymes, especially CTX-M-15, are the dominant type of ESBL. Altogether, these results suggest that CTX-M carriage is evolving toward a global pandemic but is still insufficiently described. Only a better knowledge of its dynamics and biology will lead to further development of appropriate control measures.},

abstract = {In many bacterial species, DNA damage triggers the SOS response; a pathway that regulates the production of DNA repair and damage tolerance proteins, including error-prone DNA polymerases. These specialised polymerases are capable of bypassing lesions in the template DNA, a process known as translesion synthesis (TLS). Specificity for lesion types varies considerably between the different types of TLS polymerases. TLS polymerases are mainly described as working in the context of replisomes that are stalled at lesions or in lesion-containing gaps left behind the replisome. Recently, a series of single-molecule fluorescence microscopy studies have revealed that two TLS polymerases, pol IV and pol V, rarely colocalise with replisomes in Escherichia coli cells, suggesting that most TLS activity happens in a non-replisomal context. In this review, we re-visit the evidence for the involvement of TLS polymerases in other pathways. A series of genetic and biochemical studies indicates that TLS polymerases could participate in nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination and transcription. In addition, oxidation of the nucleotide pool, which is known to be induced by multiple stressors, including many antibiotics, appears to favour TLS polymerase activity and thus increases mutation rates. Ultimately, participation of TLS polymerases within non-replisomal pathways may represent a major source of mutations in bacterial cells and calls for more extensive investigation.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance has become an imminent concern for public health. As methods for detection and characterization of antimicrobial resistance move from targeted culture and polymerase chain reaction to high throughput metagenomics, appropriate resources for the analysis of large-scale data are required. Currently, antimicrobial resistance databases are tailored to smaller-scale, functional profiling of genes using highly descriptive annotations. Such characteristics do not facilitate the analysis of large-scale, ecological sequence datasets such as those produced with the use of metagenomics for surveillance. In order to overcome these limitations, we present MEGARes (https://megares.meglab.org), a hand-curated antimicrobial resistance database and annotation structure that provides a foundation for the development of high throughput acyclical classifiers and hierarchical statistical analysis of big data. MEGARes can be browsed as a stand-alone resource through the website or can be easily integrated into sequence analysis pipelines through download. Also via the website, we provide documentation for AmrPlusPlus, a user-friendly Galaxy pipeline for the analysis of high throughput sequencing data that is pre-packaged for use with the MEGARes database.},

abstract = {The mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region of the gyrA and gyrB genes from 27 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli with a range of MICs of ciprofloxacin from 0.007 to 128 micrograms/ml and of nalidixic acid from 2 to {\textgreater} 2,000 micrograms/ml were determined by DNA sequencing. All 15 isolates with ciprofloxacin MICs of {\textgreater} or = 1 micrograms/ml showed a change in Ser-83 to Leu of GyrA protein, whereas in clinical isolates with a MIC of {\textgreater} or = 8 micrograms/ml (11 strains), a double change in Ser-83 and Asp-87 was found. All isolates with a MIC of nalidixic acid of {\textgreater} or = 128 micrograms/ml showed a mutation at amino acid codon Ser-83. Only 1 of the 27 clinical isolates of E. coli analyzed showed a change in Lys-447 of the B subunit of DNA gyrase. A change in Ser-83 is sufficient to generate a high level of resistance to nalidixic acid, whereas a second mutation at Asp-87 in the A subunit of DNA gyrase may play a complementary role in developing the strain's high levels of ciprofloxacin resistance.},

abstract = {High throughput sequencing is now fast and cheap enough to be considered part of the toolbox for investigating bacteria, and there are thousands of bacterial genome sequences available for comparison in the public domain. Bacterial genome analysis is increasingly being performed by diverse groups in research, clinical and public health labs alike, who are interested in a wide array of topics related to bacterial genetics and evolution. Examples include outbreak analysis and the study of pathogenicity and antimicrobial resistance. In this beginner's guide, we aim to provide an entry point for individuals with a biology background who want to perform their own bioinformatics analysis of bacterial genome data, to enable them to answer their own research questions. We assume readers will be familiar with genetics and the basic nature of sequence data, but do not assume any computer programming skills. The main topics covered are assembly, ordering of contigs, annotation, genome comparison and extracting common typing information. Each section includes worked examples using publicly available E. coli data and free software tools, all which can be performed on a desktop computer.},

abstract = {The soxRS regulon is a cornerstone of the adaptive defense systems of Escherichia coli against oxidative stress. Unexpectedly, activation of this regulon also enhances bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics that seem unrelated to oxygen radicals. We previously correlated this multiple antibiotic resistance with a reduced rate of synthesis of the OmpF outer membrane porin that does not affect the OmpC or OmpA porins. Studies presented here, with operon and gene fusions of ompF to lacZ, show that the soxRS-dependent repression of OmpF is achieved posttranscriptionally. We also show posttranscriptional repression of OmpF mediated by the soxQ1 mutation, which maps to the marA locus. These repressions are dependent on the micF gene, which encodes a small RNA partially complementary to the 5' end of the ompF message. Northern (RNA) blotting experiments show that micF transcription is strongly inducible by the superoxide-generating agent paraquat in a manner that depends completely on the soxRS locus. The soxR-constitutive and soxQ1 mutations elevate the expression of micF in the absence of redox stress. However, the antibiotic resistance mediated by a soxR-constitutive mutation was only partially reversed upon deletion of micF. The soxRS regulon therefore includes other components that contribute to general antibiotic resistance, although the relation of this phenotype to oxidative stress remains to be established.},

Therefore, distribution of ESBL genes, plasmids and strain genotypes in Escherichia coli obtained from poultry and retail chicken meat in the Netherlands was determined and defined as 'poultry-associated' (PA). Subsequently, the proportion of E. coli isolates with PA ESBL genes, plasmids and strains was quantified in a representative sample of clinical isolates. The E. coli were derived from 98 retail chicken meat samples, a prevalence survey among poultry, and 516 human clinical samples from 31 laboratories collected during a 3-month period in 2009. Isolates were analysed using an ESBL-specific microarray, sequencing of ESBL genes, PCR-based replicon typing of plasmids, plasmid multi-locus sequence typing (pMLST) and strain genotyping (MLST). Six ESBL genes were defined as PA (bla(CTX-M-1) , bla(CTX-M-2) , bla(SHV-2) , bla(SHV-12) , bla(TEM-20) , bla(TEM-52) ): 35{\%} of the human isolates contained PA ESBL genes and 19{\%} contained PA ESBL genes located on IncI1 plasmids that were genetically indistinguishable from those obtained from poultry (meat). Of these ESBL genes, 86{\%} were bla(CTX-M-1) and bla(TEM-52) genes, which were also the predominant genes in poultry (78{\%}) and retail chicken meat (75{\%}). Of the retail meat samples, 94{\%} contained ESBL-producing isolates of which 39{\%} belonged to E. coli genotypes also present in human samples. These findings are suggestive for transmission of ESBL genes, plasmids and E. coli isolates from poultry to humans, most likely through the food chain.},

There has been a growing list of multidrug and drug-specific efflux pumps characterized from bacteria of human, animal, plant and environmental origins. These pumps are mostly encoded on the chromosome, although they can also be plasmid-encoded. A previous article in this journal provided a comprehensive review regarding efflux-mediated drug resistance in bacteria. In the past 5 years, significant progress has been achieved in further understanding of drug resistance-related efflux transporters and this review focuses on the latest studies in this field since 2003. This has been demonstrated in multiple aspects that include but are not limited to: further molecular and biochemical characterization of the known drug efflux pumps and identification of novel drug efflux pumps; structural elucidation of the transport mechanisms of drug transporters; regulatory mechanisms of drug efflux pumps; determining the role of the drug efflux pumps in other functions such as stress responses, virulence and cell communication; and development of efflux pump inhibitors. Overall, the multifaceted implications of drug efflux transporters warrant novel strategies to combat multidrug resistance in bacteria.},

@article{Martinez-Martinez2003,
abstract = {Sir, Resistance to quinolones in Gram-negative bacteria is usually caused by chromosomal mutations that alter the target en-zymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV or activate the efflux systems that pump the drugs out of the cytoplasm. Loss of porin channels for drug entry may also contribute to resistance, but is less important. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance, long thought not to exist, has recently been dis-covered. 1 Conjugative plasmid pMG252, found in a clinical isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae, mediates a four-to 16-fold increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones and nalidixic acid, thus facilitating ciprofloxacin MICs as high as 32 mg/L in a K. pneumoniae strain already partially quinolone resistant. In wild-type K. pneumoniae or Escherichia coli strains pMG252 still augmented resistance but only to ciprofloxacin MICs of 0.125â0.25 mg/L, well below the clinical breakpoint for loss of susceptibility. However, from such an E. coli strain carrying pMG252, mutants could be selected with succes-sively higher levels of resistance up to a ciprofloxacin MIC of 4 mg/L. 1 The plasmid locus responsible for quinolone resistance is termed qnr. The gene has been cloned and sequenced. It encodes a 218-amino-acid protein that belongs to the penta-peptide repeat family of proteins. 2 Purified Qnr has been shown to block inhibition of E. coli DNA gyrase by cipro-floxacin in a cell-free system. 2 The objective of the present study was to evaluate the interaction of resistance determined by plasmid pMG252 with defined chromosomal mechanisms of quinolone resistance to gain an insight into how higher levels of resistance could develop. Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Plasmid pMG252 carries qnr, bla FOX-5 and genes for resistance to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamide, trimethoprim and mercuric chloride. The AmpC-type $\beta$-lactamase gene bla FOX-5 confers resistance to ceftazidime and other $\beta$-lactams. The plasmid was transferred from E. coli J53 pMG252 into recipient strains by conjugation and selection on minimal medium A lacking methionine and proline required by J53, and containing ampicillin (100 mg/L) or ceftazidime (10 mg/L) for selection. Quinolones were not used to select trans-conjugants in order to avoid selecting quinolone resistance mutations in recipients. The following quinolones were evaluated: ciprofloxacin (Sigma), clinafloxacin (Parke-Davis, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), levofloxacin (Hoechst-Marion-Roussel, Romainville, France), nalidixic acid (Sigma), norfloxacin (Sigma), pefloxacin (Rh{\^{o}}ne-Poulenc, Paris, France), sparfloxacin (Rh{\^{o}}ne-Poulenc) and trovafloxacin (Pfizer). Quinolones were tested in the range 0.002â256 mg/L. MICs were deter-mined by microdilution, according to NCCLS guidelines. 3 E. coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were used as reference strains for quinolone MIC determinations. Plasmid pMG252 was introduced into E. coli strains with quinolone resistance mutations in genes for DNA gyrase sub-units gyrA and gyrB and topoisomerase IV subunit parC. The plasmid was also transferred into E. coli strains with reduced susceptibility to quinolones and other antibiotics because of mutation at the marR regulatory locus. Finally, pMG252 was transmitted to E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains defective in outer membrane porin channels. As shown in Table 1, quino-lone resistance increased four to 128 times when plasmid pMG252 was present in every strain, with the exception that nalidixic acid resistance did not change in E. coli gyrB mutants N-24 and N-31. These findings indicate that qnr can supplement resistance due to altered quinolone target enzymes, efflux pump activation or deficiencies in outer membrane porin channels. The demonstration that plasmid and chromosomal mech-anisms for resistance are additive means that plasmids like pMG252 can supplement quinolone resistance in clinical isolates, whatever their mechanisms of resistance, and also that the whole panoply of chromosomal quinolone resistance mutations can be selected in strains with Qnr plasmids as higher level resistant derivatives. In addition, Qnr facilitates selection of quinolone-resistant mutations by raising the level at which they can be selected. 1 Plasmids encoding Qnr are Correspondence 1038 thus important both for the low-level resistance they carry and as agents facilitating steps to higher resistance levels.},

S16 features a T-even morphology and a highly modified 160 kbp dsDNA genome with 36.9 mol {\%} G+C, containing 269 putative coding sequences and three tRNA genes. S16 is a virulent phage, and exhibits a maximally broad host range within the genus Salmonella, but does not infect other bacteria. Synthesis of functional S16 full-length long tail fibre (LTF) in Escherichia coli was possible by coexpression of gp37 and gp38. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed nanomolar equilibrium affinity of the LTF to its receptor on Salmonella cells. We show that OmpC serves as primary binding ligand, and that S16 adsorption can be transferred to E. coli by substitution of ompC with the Salmonella homologue. S16 also infects 'rough' Salmonella strains which are defective in lipopolysaccharide synthesis and/or its carbohydrate substitution, indicating that this interaction does not require an intact LPS structure. Altogether, its virulent nature, broad host range and apparent lack of host DNA transduction render S16 highly suitable for biocontrol of Salmonella in foods and animal production. The S16 LTF represents a highly specific affinity reagent useful for cell decoration and labelling, as well as bacterial immobilization and separation.},

abstract = {The DNA fragment containing the acrA locus of the Escherichia coli chromosome has been cloned by using a complementation test. The nucleotide sequence indicates the presence of two open reading frames (ORFs). Sequence analysis suggests that the first ORF encodes a 397-residue lipoprotein with a 24-amino-acid signal peptide at its N terminus. One inactive allele of acrA from strain N43 was shown to contain an IS2 element inserted into this ORF. Therefore, this ORF was designated acrA. The second downstream ORF is predicted to encode a transmembrane protein of 1,049 amino acids and is named acrE. Genes acrA and acrE are probably located on the same operon, and both of their products are likely to affect drug susceptibilities observed in wild-type cells. The cellular localizations of these polypeptides have been analyzed by making acrA::TnphoA and acrE::TnphoA fusion proteins. Interestingly, AcrA and AcrE share 65 and 77{\%} amino acid identity with two other E. coli polypeptides, EnvC and EnvD, respectively. Drug susceptibilities in one acrA mutant (N43) and one envCD mutant (PM61) have been determined and compared. Finally, the possible functions of these proteins are discussed.},

abstract = {Increasing antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern. Fluoroquinolones are used to treat and prevent poultry diseases worldwide. Fluoroquinolone resistance rates are high in their countries of use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an acids-based feed additive, as well as fluoroquinolone antibiotics, on the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant E. coli. A total of 480 broiler chickens (Ross 308) were randomly assigned to 3 treatments: a control group receiving a basal diet; a group receiving a feed additive (FA) based on formic acid, acetic acid and propionic acid; and an antibiotic enrofloxacin (AB) group given the same diet, but supplemented with enrofloxacin in water. A pooled fecal sample of one-day-old chicks was collected upon arrival at the experimental farm. On d 17 and d 38 of the trial, cecal samples from each of the 8 pens were taken, and the count of E. coli and antibiotic-resistant E. coli was determined.The results of the present study show a high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant E. coli in one-day-old chicks. Supplementation of the diet with FA and treatment of broilers with AB did not have a significant influence on the total number of E. coli in the cecal content on d 17 and d 38 of the trial. Supplementation with FA contributed to better growth performance and to a significant decrease (P â¤ 0.05) in E. coli resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline compared to the control and AB groups, as well as to a decrease (P â¤ 0.05) in sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli compared to the AB group. Treatment with AB increased (P â¤ 0.05) the average daily weight compared to the control group and increased (P â¤ 0.05) the number of E. coli resistant to ciprofloxacin, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline; it also decreased (P â¤ 0.05) the number of E. coli resistant to cefotaxime and extended spectrum beta-lactamase- (ESBL-) producing E. coli in the ceca of broilers.},

abstract = {These studies provide evidence that binding of HDL3 to the HDL receptor stimulates translocation and efflux of intracellular cholesterol through mechanisms involving the activation of protein kinase C. This conclusion is supported by data demonstrating that HDL is able to increase cell diacylglycerol levels and activate protein kinase C. Sphingosine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, was able to inhibit HDL3-mediated cholesterol translocation and efflux, further suggesting a role for protein kinase C in HDL receptor-dependent cholesterol efflux. Inhibition of HDL-mediated diacylglycerol formation by pertussis toxin suggests the possible involvement of a G protein-activated phospholipase. Further studies are needed to understand how activation of protein kinase C promotes cholesterol translocation and to identify the target proteins for protein kinase C phosphorylation.},

abstract = {Plasmid pTKH11, originally obtained by electroporation of a Klebsiella oxytoca plasmid preparation into Escherichia coli XAC, expressed a high level of an AmpC-like beta-lactamase. The enzyme, designated CMY-5, conferred resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactams in E. coli; nevertheless, the phenotype was cryptic in the K. oxytoca donor. Determination of the complete nucleotide sequence of pTKH11 revealed that the 8,193-bp plasmid encoded seven open reading frames, including that for the CMY-5 beta-lactamase (blaCMY-5). The blaCMY-5 product was similar to the plasmidic CMY-2 beta-lactamase of K. pneumoniae and the chromosomal AmpC of Citrobacter freundii, with 99.7 and 97.0{\%} identities, respectively; there was a substitution of phenylalanine in CMY-5 for isoleucine 105 in CMY-2. blaCMY-5 was followed by the Blc and SugE genes of C. freundii, and this cluster exhibited a genetic organization identical to that of the ampC region on the chromosome of C. freundii; these results confirmed that C. freundii AmpC was the evolutionary origin of the plasmidic cephamycinases. In the K. oxytoca host, the copy number of pTKH11 was very low and the plasmid coexisted with plasmid pNBL63. Analysis of the replication regions of the two plasmids revealed 97{\%} sequence similarity in the RNA I transcripts; this result implied that the two plasmids might be incompatible. Incompatibility of the two plasmids might explain the cryptic phenotype of blaCMY-5 in K. oxytoca through an exclusion effect on pTKH11 by resident plasmid pNBL63.},

abstract = {The mobilome is a pool of genes located within mobile genetic elements (MGE), such as plasmids, IS elements, transposons, genomic/pathogenicity islands, and integron-associated gene cassettes. These genes are often referred to as "flexible" and may encode virulence factors, toxic compounds as well as resistance to antibiotics. The phenomenon of MGE transfer between bacteria, known as horizontal gene transfer (HGT), is well documented. The genes present on MGE are subject to continuous processes of evolution and environmental changes, largely induced or significantly accelerated by man. For bacteria, the only chance of survival in an environment contaminated with toxic chemicals, heavy metals and antibiotics is the acquisition of genes providing the ability to survive in such conditions. The process of acquiring and spreading antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) is of particular significance, as it is important for the health of humans and animals. Therefore, it is important to thoroughly study the mobilome of Aeromonas spp. that is widely distributed in various environments, causing many diseases in fishes and humans. This review discusses the recently published information on MGE prevalent in Aeromonas spp. with special emphasis on plasmids belonging to different incompatibility groups, i.e., IncA/C, IncU, IncQ, IncF, IncI, and ColE-type. The vast majority of plasmids carry a number of different transposons (Tn3, Tn21, Tn1213, Tn1721, Tn4401), the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd class of integrons, IS elements (e.g., IS26, ISPa12, ISPa13, ISKpn8, ISKpn6) and encode determinants such as antibiotic and mercury resistance genes, as well as virulence factors. Although the actual role of Aeromonas spp. as a human pathogen remains controversial, species of this genus may pose a serious risk to human health. This is due to the considerable potential of their mobilome, particularly in terms of antibiotic resistance and the possibility of the horizontal transfer of resistance genes.},

abstract = {Numerous tools allowing the rapid and universal identification of the clones/clonal complexes/phylogroups of Escherichia coli have been developed, as it is a commensal of the vertebrate gut, a major pathogen in veterinary and human medicine, and a bacterial indicator of faecal contamination. The ability to identify clones/clonal complexes/phylogroups is crucial, as a strain's ecological niche, lifestyle, and propensity to cause disease varies with its phylogenetic origins. There are currently three multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) schemes for E. coli, as well as several PCR based assays for determining a strain's phylogroup or clonal complex. In this work, we present data that will enable investigators to determine the correspondence between the PCR based assays and the three MSLT schemes, and provide the means for assigning an ST to a phylogroup when no other data on the strain phylogroup membership is available. Such information will help the scientific community to accurately identify the E. coli clones reported in various publications. Although whole-genome sequencing will replace classical MLST and most alternative PCR-based methods, the ST nomenclature of the MLST scheme hosted at the University of Warwick will largely persist.},

Much attention has been paid to the emergence of pathogenic micro-organisms such as enterococci or Salmonella that have developed resistance mechanisms that render them almost untreatable with current antibiotics. One of the alleged reasons for such an emergence is the non-medical use of antibiotics, especially in animals. However, only recently have veterinary forums and journals begun to discuss this topic. On the other hand, anti-microbial resistance has also become a problem in veterinary medicine and the number of reports indicating high rates of resistance among animal-originated micro-organisms is considerable. The present review deals with the mechanisms of resistance known for antibiotics in common veterinary use, the problem of anti-microbial resistance in veterinary medicine and the links between the use of antibiotics in animals and the emergence of anti-microbial resistance in humans.},

We report the complete sequence of a plasmid, pC15-1a, that was found associated with the outbreak strain. Plasmid pC15-1a is a circular molecule of 92,353 bp consisting of two distinct regions. The first is a 64-kb region that is essentially homologous to the non-R-determinant region of plasmid R100 except for several point mutations, a few small insertions and deletions, and the absence of Tn10. The second is a 28.4-kb multidrug resistance region (MDR) that has replaced the R-determinant region of the R100 progenitor and consists mostly of transposons or partial transposons and five copies of the insertion element IS26. All drug resistance genes found in pC15-1a, including the beta-lactamase genes bla(CTX-M-15), bla(OXA-1), and bla(TEM-1), the tetracycline resistance gene tetA, and aminoglycoside resistance genes aac(6')-Ib and aac(3)-II, are located in the MDR. The bla(CTX-M-15) gene was found downstream of ISEcp1as part of a transposition unit, as determined from the surrounding sequence. Examination of the plasmids from CTX-M-15-harboring strains isolated from hospitals across Canada showed that pC15-1a was found in several strains isolated from a site in western Canada. Comparison of pC15-1a and pCTX15, found in an E. coli strain isolated in India in 1999, revealed that the plasmids had several features in common, including an R100 backbone and several of the resistance genes, including bla(CTX-M-15), bla(TEM-1), bla(OXA-1), tetA, and aac(6')-Ib.},

abstract = {An agar-plate assay was adapted to examine aspects of quinolone structure that restrict the emergence of quinolone-mediated quinolone resistance. When Escherichia coli was applied to agar containing nalidixic acid, the number of quinolone-resistant mutants arising during incubation was decreased by raising the drug concentration and by mutations expected to block the induction of the SOS response (recA, lexA); the mutant number was increased by a mutator mutation (ung). The examination of four related fluoroquinolones then revealed that a C-8 methoxy group and an N-ethyl piperazine substituent at C-7 reduced mutant acquisition more effectively than C-8 H and C-7 C-ethyl piperazine groups. The fluoroquinolone that was most effective at restricting mutant acquisition was the most active when lethal activity was measured on agar plates or in liquid medium (as minimal bactericidal concentration). It also exhibited the lowest ratio of mutant MIC to wild-type MIC when it was tested with a set of isogenic gyrase mutants, and it had a low mutant prevention concentration (MPC) relative to MIC. However, a low MPC was less likely to be important in restricting the induced mutant accumulation because a fluoroquinolone N-ethyl piperazine substituent was more effective than a C-ethyl piperazine substituent at reducing mutant accumulation but was less effective at lowering the MPC. An 8-methoxy-quinazoline-2,4-dione was also effective at restricting the accumulation of resistant mutants on agar. Collectively, these data characterize a simple assay for detection of drug-mediated resistance that is sensitive to the structures of GyrA inhibitors. The assay provides a new method for screening quinolones and quinolone-like molecules that complements MPC-based tests for restricting the emergence of resistance.},

abstract = {Objectives: The aac(6â²)-Ib gene encodes many variants of an aminoglycoside-acetyltransferase enzyme that is responsible for amikacin resistance. Recently, a new variant aac(6â²)-Ib-cr capable of modifying aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones has been described. The aim of our study was to observe the appearance and the location of the aac(6â²)-Ib gene in extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains. Methods: Sixty-six and nine non-clonal ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains were isolated, respectively, for one 3-year period from 1999 to 2001 and one 2-month period in 2005 in a French Hospital (Paris, France). Results: Among these isolates, 35 of them carried the aac(6â²)-Ib gene. Fourteen out of the aac(6â²)-Ib genes of the period 1 and two of the period 2 were genes cassette located within class 1 integrons, whereas 16 and 3, respectively, were outside integrons. One of these encoded an aminoglycoside-acetyltransferase enzyme leading to an acetyltransferase that confers resistance to all aminoglycosides. The new -cr variant of aac(6â²)-Ib was detected in three Escherichia coli isolates in 2005 always associated with CTX-M-15 enzyme. Conclusions: The aac(6â²)-Ib-cr gene, responsible for antibiotic resistance to two very different drugs, is emerging in ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated in France especially in strains carrying the blaCTx-M-15 gene. {\textcopyright} 2008 The British Infection Society.},

Twenty-five and 79 clinical cases with ESBL-producing E. coli and 22 cases and one case with CMY-producing E. coli were identified in Pittsburgh and Seville, respectively. Among them all, community-acquired and healthcare-associated cases together constituted 60{\%} of the cases in Pittsburgh and 73{\%} in Seville. Community-acquired cases were more common in Seville than in Pittsburgh (49{\%} vs. 13{\%}; p {\textless}0.001). ESBL-producing and CMY-producing E. coli isolates were commonly recovered from the local retail meat. In particular, 67{\%} (8/12) of retail chickens in Seville and 85{\%} (17/20) of those in Pittsburgh contained ESBL-producing and CMY-producing E. coli isolates, respectively. Among the ESBL-producing isolates, CTX-M and SHV were the most common ESBL types in both clinical and meat isolates. Approximately half of the ESBL-producing and CMY-producing E. coli isolates from meat belonged to phylogenetic groups associated with virulent extra-intestinal infections in humans. Community and healthcare environments are now significant reservoirs of ESBL-producing and CMY-producing E. coli. Retail meat is a potential source of these organisms.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli were recovered from the members of two two-person households and their associated septic tanks. The E. coli were isolated using selective and non-selective isolation techniques, characterized using the method of multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis and screened for the presence of virulence factors associated with extra-intestinal disease by using PCR. The growth rateâtemperature relationships of strains from the two habitats were also determined. Temporal variation explained 25{\%} of the observed electrophoretic type (ET) diversity in the humans. Among-host variation accounted for 29{\%} of the observed allelic diversity. In one household, ET diversity of the E. coli population in the septic tank was significantly lower than ET diversity in the humans providing the inputs to the septic tank. Molecular analysis of variance revealed that, on average, strains recovered from the septic tank of this household were genetically distinct from strains recovered from the humans providing the faecal inputs to the septic tank. Further, the growth rateâtemperature response of strains differed between strains isolated from the septic tank and strains isolated from the humans. Septic tank isolates grew better at low temperatures than strains isolated from humans, but more slowly at high temperatures compared to the human isolates. By contrast, no real differences in ET diversity, allelic diversity, or the growth charcteristics of strains could be detected between strains from the humans and strains from the septic tank of the other household. The results of this study suggest there are strains of E. coli that are better âadapted' to conditions found in the external environment compared to strains isolated from the gastrointestinal habitat. Further, the finding that the numerically dominant clones and clonal diversity in secondary habitats can differ substantially from those found in the source populations will confound efforts to identify the sources of faecal pollution in the environment.},

abstract = {During the past 10 years, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae have become a substantial challenge to infection control. It has been suggested by clinicians that the effectiveness of antibiotics is in such rapid decline that, depending on the pathogen concerned, their future utility can be measured in decades or even years. Unless the rise in antibiotic resistance can be reversed, we can expect to see a substantial rise in incurable infection and fatality in both developed and developing regions. Antibiotic resistance develops through complex interactions, with resistance arising by de-novo mutation under clinical antibiotic selection or frequently by acquisition of mobile genes that have evolved over time in bacteria in the environment. The reservoir of resistance genes in the environment is due to a mix of naturally occurring resistance and those present in animal and human waste and the selective effects of pollutants, which can co-select for mobile genetic elements carrying multiple resistant genes. Less attention has been given to how anthropogenic activity might be causing evolution of antibiotic resistance in the environment. Although the economics of the pharmaceutical industry continue to restrict investment in novel biomedical responses, action must be taken to avoid the conjunction of factors that promote evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {During recent years a rapid increase of quinolone resistant Escherichia coli have been noted in the Swedish broiler population, despite the lack of a known selective pressure. The current study wanted to investigate if imported breeding birds could be a source for the quinolone resistant E. coli. The occurrence of quinolone resistant E. coli was investigated, using selective cultivation with nalidixic acid, in grand-parent birds on arrival to Sweden and their progeny. In addition, sampling in hatcheries and empty cleaned poultry houses was performed. Clonality of isolates was investigated using a 10-loci multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). To identify the genetic basis for the resistance isolates were also analysed for occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants and characterization of chromosomal mutations. E. coli resistant to nalidixic acid occurred in grandparent birds imported to Sweden for breeding purposes. Four predominant MLVA types were identified in isolates from grandparent birds, parent birds and broilers. However, resistant E. coli with identical MLVA patterns were also present in hatcheries and poultry houses suggesting that the environment plays a role in the occurrence. Nalidixic acid resistance was due to a mutation in the gyrA gene and no PMQR could be identified. The occurrence of identical clones in all levels of the production pyramid points to that quinolone resistant E. coli can be introduced through imported breeding birds and spread by vertical transmission to all levels of the broiler production pyramid.},

abstract = {High resistance rates to nalidixic acid (NAL) in Vibrio cholerae serogroup O139 strains have been found, and ciprofloxacin (CIP) resistance is also observed. In this study, mutations within the quinolone-resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from NAL-resistant O139 strains were analysed. The predominant mutation profile was S83I in GyrA in combination with S85L in ParC. In addition, the combination substitutions of D87N in GyrA and D420N in ParE in combination with S83I in GyrA and S85L in ParC as well as D87N in GyrA and P439S in ParE in combination with S83I in GyrA and S85L in ParC were found in the CIP-resistant strains. A series of site-directed mutants comprising D87 in GyrA, D420 in ParE and P439 in ParE were constructed from a wild-type V. cholerae O139 strain carrying the common mutations S83I in GyrA and S85L in ParC. Introduction of the mutation D87N in GyrA increased the CIP minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the mutant strain by nearly 4-fold compared with the initial strain. The second introduction of D420N in ParE further significantly increased the CIP MIC to ca. 23-fold compared with the initial strain. A second introduction of P439S in ParE also increased the CIP MIC by 17-fold. Therefore, it is concluded that the emergence of D87N in GyrA and D420N or P439S in ParE dramatically induces resistance to fluoroquinolones in V. cholerae O139, and the accumulation of multiple mutations in the QRDRs confers significant resistance to fluoroquinolones in V. cholerae.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although optimization of the fluoroquinolone dosage increases the efficacy of this class of drugs against bacterial infections, its impact on the emergence of resistance in commensal bacteria is unknown. METHODS: Six different 14-day dosages of oral ciprofloxacin were randomly assigned to 48 healthy volunteers. Individual pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters combining antibiotic exposure in plasma, saliva, and stool specimens and ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and mutant prevention concentrations against viridans group streptococci in the pharyngeal flora and Escherichia coli in the fecal flora were estimated. Their links with the emergence of resistance to nalidixic acid or ciprofloxacin in the fecal flora and to levofloxacin in the pharyngeal flora 7, 14, or 42 days after ciprofloxacin initiation were investigated. RESULTS: Resistance emerged in the fecal and pharyngeal flora of 25{\%} and 33{\%} of the subjects, respectively, mainly when local concentrations of ciprofloxacin were less than the MIC. No variable that integrated pharmacokinetic data and pharmacodynamic parameters was found to differ significantly between the subjects in whom resistance emerged and those in whom it did not. Probabilities of the emergence of resistance were not significantly different across the different antibiotic dosages. CONCLUSIONS: Selection of resistant commensals during ciprofloxacin therapy is a frequent ecological side effect that is not preventable by dosage optimization. Trial registration.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: to determine the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Escherichia coli from poultry in Great Britain (GB). METHODS: E. coli was isolated from 388 broiler chicken caecal samples from 22 abattoirs and from boot swabs from 442 turkey flocks over successive 1 year periods. CHROMagar ECC with and without cephalosporin antibiotics was used as isolation medium and the chicken study also used CHROMagar CTX. ESBL phenotype isolates were tested for the presence of bla(CTX-M,) bla(OXA), bla(SHV), bla(TEM) and ampC genes(.) CTX-M isolates were tested for O25 serogroup, replicon, CTX-M sequence, multilocus sequence type (MLST), PFGE type, plasmid transfer and qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, qepA and aac(6')-Ib genes. RESULTS: CTX-M-carrying E. coli were isolated from 54.5{\%} of the broiler abattoirs and from 3.6{\%} of individual broiler caecal samples and were CTX-M sequence types 1 (mainly), 3 and 15 with replicon types I1-gamma, A/C and P/F, and I1-gamma, respectively. CTX-M-carrying E. coli were isolated from 5.2{\%} of turkey meat production farms and 6.9{\%} of turkey breeder farms and were CTX-M sequence types 1, 14 (mainly), 15 and 55 with mainly replicon types F, FIA, K and I1-gamma, respectively. None of the CTX-M isolates was serogroup O25. PFGE/MLST showed the CTX-M isolates to be clonally diverse, although MLST 156 with CTX-M-15 was isolated from both chickens and turkeys and has been previously reported in gulls. CTX-M-negative, ESBL- and bla(TEM)-positive strains were mainly TEM-52C. CONCLUSIONS: poultry-derived CTX-M E. coli in GB are different from major CTX-M sequence types causing disease in humans.},

abstract = {Multiplex PCR amplification of lacZ, uidA and plc genes was developed for the simultaneous detection of total coliform bacteria for Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens, in drinking water. Detection by agarose gel electrophoresis yielded a band of 876 bp for the lacZ gene of all coliform bacteria; a band of 147 bp for the uidA gene and a band of 876 bp for the lacZ gene of all strains of E. coli; a band of 280 bp for the p/c gene for all strains of C. perfringens; and a negative result for all three genes when tested with other bacteria. The detection limit was 100 pg for E. coli and C. perfringens, and 1 ng for coliform bacteria when measured with purified DNA. This assay was applied to the detection of these bacteria in spiked water samples. Spiked water samples with 0-1,000 CFU/ml of coliform bacteria and/or E. coli and/or C. perfringens were detected by this multiplex PCR after a pre-enrichment step to increase the sensitivity and to ensure that the detection was based on the presence of cultivable bacteria. The result of bacterial detection from the multiplex PCR was comparable with that of a standard plate count on selective medium (p=0.62). When using standard plate counts as a gold standard, the sensitivity for this test was 99.1{\%} (95{\%} CI 95.33, 99.98) and the specificity was 90.9 {\%} (95{\%} CI 75.67, 98.08). Multiplex PCR amplification with a pre-enrichment step was shown to be an effective, sensitive and rapid method for the simultaneous detection of these three microbiological parameters in drinking water.},

Out of these 186 ESBL-positive isolates, 2.2 and 1.6{\%} carried a QnrA1 and a QnrS1 determinant, respectively.

The genetic environments of the qnrA1 gene differed but were always associated with sul1 type integrons. In contrast, qnrS1 genes were not embedded in class 1 integrons but located often (but not systematically) downstream of the insertion sequence ISEcl2 on plasmids that often carried a novel beta-lactamase gene, bla(LAP-1).

abstract = {The replication origin of Escherichia coli (oriC) was probed for specific binding proteins, using the gel shift assay. A 33-kDa protein that binds specifically to the right border of oriC, next to the rightmost of the binding sites of the initiator protein, DnaA, was identified and purified. The stoichiometry of protein to DNA is about 6 to 1. Around 5000 monomers of the protein, named Rob (right oriC binding), are present per cell. The rob gene has been located near 99.8 min on the E. coli map, cloned, and overexpressed. The total protein sequence reveals strong homologies to several regulatory proteins with which it shares the helix-turn-helix motif.},

However, there is a lack of open source software for schema definition and allele calling. Results: The chewBBACA suite was designed to assist users in the creation and evaluation of novel whole-genome or core-genome GbG schemas and allele calling in bacterial strains of interest. The alleles called by chewBBACA are potential coding sequences, allowing the user to evaluate the possible consequences of the observed diversity.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES The present study was carried out to evaluate the prevalence of clonal group O25b:H4-B2-ST131 in water environments with faecal pollution (urban sewage and river water) in the north-east of Spain and to study the virulence gene content of environmental isolates and to compare them with isolates causing human extraintestinal infections in Spain. METHODS This study was performed with 10 sewage samples (collected in Catalonia, north-eastern Spain, in autumn 2009 from the influent raw urban sewage of a wastewater treatment plant that serves a large urban area) and 6 river water samples (collected monthly from February to April 2010 in the Llobregat river catchment area, near Barcelona, a watercourse subjected to heavy anthropogenic pressure). Escherichia coli colonies were screened by PCR for the rfbO25b gene associated with the clonal group O25b:H4-B2-ST131. Sequence types (STs), serotypes, virulence genes, PFGE profiles, antimicrobial resistance and extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes were determined in 75 E. coli isolates positive for the O25b molecular subtype. RESULTS Of the 75 O25b-positive isolates, 51 belonged to the O25b:H4-B2-ST131 clonal group and the remaining 24 belonged to clonal group O25b:H4-D-ST69. The majority of ST69 isolates (23 of 24) were isolated from urban sewage, whereas ST131 isolates were isolated from urban sewage (25 isolates) as well as from river water (26 isolates). ST131 and ST69 isolates carried 4-13 virulence genes, the majority (82{\%}) being quinolone resistant. CONCLUSIONS We showed the presence of E. coli isolates belonging to clonal groups O25b:H4-B2-ST131 and O25b:H4-D-ST69 in raw sewage and river water in Barcelona. Furthermore, we observed that the environmental O25b:H4-B2-ST131 isolates showed similar virulence and macrorestriction profiles to clinical human isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing the O25b:H4-D-ST69 clonal group.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to perform the molecular characterization of vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) within the faecal flora of Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx. The association with other resistance genes and the detection of virulence genes were also analysed. From 2008 to 2010, 365 faecal samples from Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx were collected and tested for VRE recovery. Mechanisms of resistance to vancomycin and other antibiotics, as well as genes encoding virulence factors were detected through PCR. Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) was performed for Enterococcus faecium strains. VRE were recovered in 8 of the 365 analysed samples. The vanA gene was identified in two E. faecium isolates recovered from Iberian wolf faecal samples and the remaining six showed intrinsic resistance (3 vanC1-E. gallinarum and 3 vanC2-E. casseliflavus, from Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx faecal samples, respectively). One vanA-containing isolate showed tetracycline and erythromycin resistance [with erm(B) and tet(L) genes] and the other one also exhibited ampicillin and kanamycin resistance [with erm(B), tet(M) and aph(3')-III genes]. One of the vanA-isolates revealed a new sequence type named ST573 and the other one belonged to the CC17 clonal complex (ST18). The hyl gene was detected in one E. casseliflavus and three E. gallinarum but not among vanA-positive isolates, and the occurrence of cylA and cylL genes was confirmed in two E. casseliflavus isolates. A low prevalence of VRE has been detected in faecal samples of Iberian wolf and Iberian lynx and strains with an acquired mechanism of resistance to vancomycin have not been detected among Iberian lynx.},

abstract = {Aims: To estimate the proportions of farms on which broilers, turkeys and pigs were shedding fluoroquinolone (FQ)-resistant Escherichia coli or Campylobacter spp. near to slaughter.Methods and Results: Freshly voided faeces were collected on 89 poultry and 108 pig farms and cultured with media containing 1{\textperiodcentered}0 mg l22121 ciprofloxacin. Studies demonstrated the specificity of this sensitive method, and both poultry and pig sampling yielded FQ-resistant E. coli on 60{\%} of farms. FQ-resistant Campylobacter spp. were found on around 22{\%} of poultry and 75{\%} of pig farms. The majority of resistant isolates of Campylobacter (89{\%}) and E. coli (96{\%}) tested had minimum inhibitory concentrations for ciprofloxacin of 22658 mg l22121. The proportion of resistant E. coli and Campylobacter organisms within samples varied widely.Conclusions: FQ resistance is commonly present among two enteric bacterial genera prevalent on pig and poultry farms, although the low proportion of resistant organisms in many cases requires a sensitive detection technique.Significance and Impact of the Study: FQ-resistant bacteria with zoonotic potential appear to be present on a high proportion of UK pig and poultry farms. The risk this poses to consumers relative to other causes of FQ-resistant human infections remains to be clarified.},

abstract = {ARG-ANNOT (Antibiotic Resistance Gene-ANNOTation) is a new bioinformatic tool that was created to detect existing and putative new antibiotic resistance (AR) genes in bacterial genomes. ARG-ANNOT uses a local BLAST program in Bio-Edit software that allows the user to analyze sequences without a Web interface. All AR genetic determinants were collected from published works and online resources; nucleotide and protein sequences were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank database. After building a database that includes 1,689 antibiotic resistance genes, the software was tested in a blind manner using 100 random sequences selected from the database to verify that the sensitivity and specificity were at 100{\%} even when partial sequences were queried. Notably, BLAST analysis results obtained using the rmtF gene sequence (a new aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme gene sequence that is not included in the database) as a query revealed that the tool was able to link this sequence to short sequences (17 to 40 bp) found in other genes of the rmt family with significant E values. Finally, the analysis of 178 Acinetobacter baumannii and 20 Staphylococcus aureus genomes allowed the detection of a significantly higher number of AR genes than the Resfinder gene analyzer and 11 point mutations in target genes known to be associated with AR. The average time for the analysis of a genome was 3.35 +/- 0.13 min. We have created a concise database for BLAST using a Bio-Edit interface that can detect AR genetic determinants in bacterial genomes and can rapidly and easily discover putative new AR genetic determinants.},

We report that 13{\%} of the strains of the ECOR collection, a sample of 72 E. coli isolates representing the breadth of genetic variation of the species, produce msDNA. Three of the four major subspecific groups include msDNA-producing strains. Screening of 25 isolates that are genetically related to msDNA-producing clinical strains uncovered 22 additional msDNA-producing strains. A phylogenetic tree based on allelic variation detected electrophoretically at 20 enzyme-encoding loci revealed two major clusters and several deep branches composed of strains that synthesize msDNA. Although E. coli K-12 does not harbor msDNA, other closely related strains of the K-12 family do. The results support the hypothesis that msDNA-synthesizing systems, including reverse transcriptase genes, were acquired recently and independently in different lineages of E. coli.},

This backbone can acquire additional functions probably through the action of insertion sequences, transposons and specific recombinases. Previously, ICEs were thought of as only vectors for transfer of antibiotic resistance genes, but it is now evident that ICEs can mediate the transfer of a very diverse set of functions. ICEs allow bacteria to rapidly adapt to new environmental conditions and to colonize new niches. Like phages and conjugative plasmids they also likely mediate the transfer of virulence determinants. ICEs shape the bacterial genome, promoting variability between strains of the same species and distributing genes between unrelated bacterial genera. Finally, we propose that by utilizing conserved integration sites, ICEs may promote the mobilization of genomic islands. ?? 2004 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli resistance to quinolones has now become a serious issue in large-scale pig farms of China. It is necessary to study the dynamics of quinolone resistance in fecal Escherichia coli of pigs after antimicrobial administration. Here, we present the hypothesis that the emergence of resistance in pigs requires drug accumulation for 7 days or more. To test this hypothesis, 26 pigs (90 days old, about 30 kg) not fed any antimicrobial after weaning were selected and divided into 2 equal groups: the experimental (EP) group and control (CP) group. Pigs in the EP group were orally treated daily with 5 mg ciprofloxacin/kg of body weight for 30 days, and pigs in the CP group were fed a normal diet. Fresh feces were collected at 16 time points from day 0 to day 61. At each time point, ten E. coli clones were tested for susceptibility to quinolones and mutations of gyrA and parC. The results showed that the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ciprofloxacin increased 16-fold compared with the initial MIC (0.5 Âµg/ml) after ciprofloxacin administration for 3 days and decreased 256-fold compared with the initial MIC (0.5 Âµg/ml) after ciprofloxacin withdrawal for 26 days. GyrA (S83 L, D87N/D87Y) and parC (S80I) substitutions were observed in all quinolone-resistant E. coli (QREC) clones with an MIC â¥8 Âµg/ml. This study provides scientific theoretical guidance for the rational use of antimicrobials and the control of bacterial resistance.},

abstract = {Development of antibiotic resistance in the microbiota of farm animals and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the agricultural sector not only threaten veterinary use of antibiotics, but jeopardize human health care as well. The effects of exposure to antibiotics on spread and development of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli from the chicken gut were studied. Groups of 15 pullets each were exposed under strictly controlled conditions to a 2-day course of amoxicillin, oxytetracycline, or enrofloxacin, added to the drinking water either at full therapeutic dose, 75{\%} of that, or at the carry-over level of 2.5{\%}. During treatment and for 12 days afterwards, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the applied antibiotics of E. coli strains isolated from cloacal swabs was measured. The full therapeutic dose yielded the highest percentage of resistant strains during and immediately after exposure. After 12 days without antibiotics, only strains from chickens that were given amoxicillin were significantly more often resistant than the untreated control. Strains isolated from pullets exposed to carry-over concentrations were only for a few days more often resistant than those from the control. These results suggest that, if chickens must be treated with antibiotics, a short intensive therapy is preferable. Even short-term exposure to carry-over levels of antibiotics can be a risk for public health, as also under those circumstances some selection for resistance takes place.},

abstract = {Exposure of Escherichia coli to superoxide-generating drugs, such as menadione or paraquat, uniquely induces approximately 40 proteins, nine of which are under the positive control of the soxR locus (at min 92). We report here that certain mutations at a separate locus that we have named soxQ (at min 34) confer some of the phenotypes seen in soxR-constitutive strains, including resistance to menadione. A previously known mutation called cfxB, identified through antibiotic resistance, is likely an allele of soxQ. The soxQ1 and cfxB mutations cause transcriptional activation of the genes that encode Mn-containing superoxide dismutase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the soi-17/19::lac and soi-28::lac fusions. These genes are also activated by soxR, but the soxQ1 and cfxB mutations increase the synthesis of seven other proteins not influenced by soxR. Moreover, the soxQ1- and cfxB-dependent phenotypes do not depend on the soxR gene, and gene induction by soxR in response to redox stress does not depend on the soxQ locus. As well as increasing cellular resistance to some oxidants, the soxQ1 and cfxB mutations confer elevated resistance to various antibiotics, probably via diminished expression of outer membrane protein OmpF. The marA1 multiple-antibiotic resistance mutation (also at min 34) behaves like a weak allele of soxQ but probably resides in a nearby gene that, with soxQ, is part of a regulatory complex. We propose that soxQ helps control some oxidative stress proteins as part of another regulon that responds to an unknown environmental signal.},

abstract = {Bacterial persisters are able to tolerate high levels of antibiotics and give rise to new populations. Persister tolerance is generally attributed to minimally active cellular processes that prevent antibiotic-induced damage, which has led to the supposition that persister offspring give rise to antibiotic-resistant mutants at comparable rates to normal cells. Using time-lapse microscopy to monitor Escherichia coli populations following ofloxacin treatment, we find that persisters filament extensively and induce impressive SOS responses before returning to a normal appearance. Further, populations derived from fluoroquinolone persisters contain significantly greater quantities of antibiotic-resistant mutants than those from untreated controls. We confirm that resistance is heritable and that the enhancement requires RecA, SOS induction, an opportunity to recover from treatment, and the involvement of error-prone DNA polymerase V (UmuDC). These findings show that fluoroquinolones damage DNA in persisters and that the ensuing SOS response accelerates the development of antibiotic resistance from these survivors.},

abstract = {Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in particular, have become a public and veterinary health concern. The search for MRS reservoirs outside human hospitals is needed in order to understand the reasons for their persistence and to control their spread. MRS have been isolated from rats, but little is known about their occurrence in foxes. In view of the perceived increasing proximity between people and foxes in the U.K. and the well-documented potential of foxes as hosts for zoonotic pathogens, this study examined whether foxes can be a reservoir for MRS. This study examined the carriage of staphylococci and their antimicrobial resistance patterns in 38 foxes (Vulpes vulpes) from rural and semirural areas in the U.K. Staphylococci were isolated by enrichment culture from nasal, oral, axillary, and perineal swabs and speciated by standard bacteriological tests and API ID32 STAPH (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Antimicrobial resistance was investigated by disc diffusion tests and identification of mecA. Thirty-seven staphylococcal isolates were identified from 35 of the 38 foxes. All isolates were coagulase-negative and most frequently included species from the S. sciuri group (35{\%}), S. equorum (27{\%}), and S. capitis (22{\%}). All were phenotypically resistant to methicillin, and mecA was detected in 33 (89{\%}) of isolates, but only 10 (27{\%}) showed broad beta-lactam antibiotic resistance. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was not identified. These results indicate that foxes are a potential wildlife reservoir for mecA-positive staphylococci. Selection pressure from environmental contamination with antimicrobials should be considered.},

abstract = {The epidemiology of an enrofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli clone was investigated during two separate outbreaks of colibacillosis in the Danish broiler production. In total five flocks were reported affected by the outbreaks. Recorded first-week mortalities were in the range of 1.7-12.7{\%}. The clone was first isolated from dead broilers and subsequently demonstrated in samples from associated hatchers and the parent flock with its embryonated eggs, suggesting a vertical transmission from the parents. The second outbreak involved two broiler flocks unrelated to the affected flocks from the first outbreak. However, the clone could not be demonstrated in the associated parent flock. Furthermore, samplings from grand-parent flocks were negative for the outbreak clone. The clonality was evaluated by plasmid profiling and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. None of the recognized virulence factors were demonstrated in the outbreak clone by microarray and PCR assay. The molecular background for the fluoroquinolone-resistance was investigated and point mutations in gyrA and parC leading to amino-acid substitutions in quinolone-resistance determining regions of GyrA and ParC were demonstrated. Vertical transmission of enrofloxacin-resistant E. coli from healthy parents resulting in high first-week mortality in the offspring illustrates the potential of the emergence and spreading of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria in animal husbandry, even though the use of fluoroquinolones is restricted. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {AIM: To identify the location and the relationship, and to analyze the genetic background of 2 plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, qnrB4 and qnrS1, carried by a clinical strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K pneumoniae). METHODS: The plasmids carrying qnrB4 or qnrS1 were identified by Southern blotting. A HindIII fragment containing qnrB4 or qnrS1 was cloned into plasmid puc18 and sequenced. RESULTS: qnrB4 and qnrS1 were located on 2 different plasmids, pHS7 and pHS8, and were 180 and 45 kb in size, respectively. A transconjugant carrying plasmid pHS7 bearing qnrB4 and another transconjugant carrying pHS9 bearing qnrB4 and qnrS1 were obtained by conjugation. Plasmid pHS8 bearing qnrS1 was also transferred to J53 by transformation. The ciprofloxacin minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for J53 transconjugants or the transformant carrying qnrB4 only, qnrS1 only, and both qnrB4 and qnrS1 were 0.19, 0.25, and 0.25 mg/L, respectively, while the parent clinical strain of K pneumoniae had a MIC of 0.75 mg/L. qnrB4 was located in a sul1-type integron with blaDHA-1, ampR and psp genes in upstream and insertion sequence IS26, and sap genes in downstream of qnrB4. qnrS1 was not located in an integron, but IS26 was found both upstream and downstream, and IS2 was found directly upstream of qnrS1. CONCLUSION: qnrB and qnrS can be harbored simultaneously by a single clinical strain of K pneumoniae. These 2 genes are carried by 2 different plasmids and have different genetic environments in plasmid DNA structure.},

The predicted products of both ORF1 and ORF4 share homology with the multidrug exporter QacC. Phenotypic analysis revealed that ORF1 specifies a resistance profile to antiseptics and disinfectants almost identical to that of qacC, whereas ORF4 specifies much lower levels of resistance to these compounds. ORF4, whose product lacks the C-terminal 16 amino acids of the ORF1 protein, may have evolved by the interruption of ORF1 from the insertion of a DNA segment carrying a sulI sulfonamide resistance determinant. Hence, ORF1 was designated qacE, and its partially functional deletion derivative, ORF4, was designated qacE delta 1. Fluorimetric experiments indicated that the mechanism of resistance mediated by QacE, the protein specified by qacE, is active export energized by proton motive force. Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed that QacE is related to a family of small multidrug export proteins with four transmembrane segments.},

In the accompanying report, we found that ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and norfloxacin MICs for fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli clinical isolates were very high and widely varied (L. Becnel Boyd, M. J. Maynard, S. K. Morgan-Linnell, L. B. Horton, R. Sucgang, R. J. Hamill, J. Rojo Jimenez, J. Versalovic, D. Steffen, and L. Zechiedrich, Antimicrob.

We found that (i) all fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates had gyrA mutations; (ii) approximately 85{\%} of gyrA mutants also had parC mutations; (iii) the ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin MICs for isolates harboring aac(6')-Ib-cr ( approximately 23{\%}) were significantly higher, but the gatifloxacin and levofloxacin MICs were not; (iv) no isolate had qnrA; and (v) approximately 33{\%} of the fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates had increased AcrA levels. Increased AcrA correlated with nonsusceptibility to the fluoroquinolones but did not correlate with nonsusceptibility to any other antimicrobial agents reported from hospital antibiograms. Known mechanisms accounted for the fluoroquinolone MICs of 50 to 70{\%} of the isolates; the remaining included isolates for which the MICs were up to 1,500-fold higher than expected. Thus, additional, unknown fluoroquinolone resistance mechanisms must be present in some clinical isolates.},

Here we examine how these factors affect the rate of adaptation utilizing a âgenderlessâ strain of Escherichia coli capable of continuous in situ sexual recombination. The results show that the populations with increased mutation rate, and capable of sexual recombination, outperform all the other populations. We further characterize two sexual and two asexual populations with increased mutation rate and observe maintenance of beneficial mutations in the sexual populations through mutational sweeps. Furthermore, we experimentally identify the molecular signature of a mating event within the sexual population that combines two beneficial mutations to generate a fitter progeny; this evidence suggests that the recombination event partially alleviates clonal interference. We present additional data suggesting that stochasticity plays an important role in the combinations of mutations observed.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli population dynamics and diversity in rats fed diets differing in their crude fibre content were assessed. Female Wistar rats (n=40) were fed diets containing 1, 4, 18 or 26{\%} crude fibre. Animals were housed in pairs, and one animal was inoculated with a phylogroup B1 strain of E. coli, the other with a phylogroup B2 strain. Natural strain transmission was allowed to occur between the animals in each cage. As expected, the diets had a significant effect on gut dynamics. Mean gut retention times were shorter in animals fed the 18 and 26{\%} crude fibre diets compared with animals on the low-fibre diets. The effect of diet on gastrointestinal dynamics in turn affected E. coli population dynamics and clonal composition. Animals fed the low-fibre diets had higher cell densities than animals fed the high-fibre diets. E. coli populations dominated by phylogroup B2 strains exhibited lower cell densities in animals fed the high-fibre diets compared with cell densities in animals fed the low-fibre diets. Overall, E. coli cell densities declined as gut transit times decreased. Results from this experiment support the results garnered from prospective studies examining the distribution of E. coli from hosts with differing diets, gut morphology and dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2011 SGM.},

abstract = {Flavonoids are ubiquitous in photosynthesising cells and are commonly found in fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, stems, flowers, tea, wine, propolis and honey. For centuries, preparations containing these compounds as the principal physiologically active constituents have been used to treat human diseases. Increasingly, this class of natural products is becoming the subject of anti-infective research, and many groups have isolated and identified the structures of flavonoids possessing antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial activity. Moreover, several groups have demonstrated synergy between active flavonoids as well as between flavonoids and existing chemotherapeutics. Reports of activity in the field of antibacterial flavonoid research are widely conflicting, probably owing to inter- and intra-assay variation in susceptibility testing. However, several high-quality investigations have examined the relationship between flavonoid structure and antibacterial activity and these are in close agreement. In addition, numerous research groups have sought to elucidate the antibacterial mechanisms of action of selected flavonoids. The activity of quercetin, for example, has been at least partially attributed to inhibition of DNA gyrase. It has also been proposed that sophoraflavone G and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate inhibit cytoplasmic membrane function, and that licochalcones A and C inhibit energy metabolism. Other flavonoids whose mechanisms of action have been investigated include robinetin, myricetin, apigenin, rutin, galangin, 2,4,2???-trihydroxy-5???- methylchalcone and lonchocarpol A. These compounds represent novel leads, and future studies may allow the development of a pharmacologically acceptable antimicrobial agent or class of agents. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.

abstract = {Quinolones are broad-spectrum synthetic antibacterial drugs first obtained during the synthesis of chloroquine. Nalidixic acid, the prototype of quinolones, first became available for clinical consumption in 1962 and was used mainly for urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli and other pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Recently, significant work has been carried out to synthesize novel quinolone analogues with enhanced activity and potential usage for the treatment of different bacterial diseases. These novel analogues are made by substitution at different sitesâthe variation at the C-6 and C-8 positions gives more effective drugs. Substitution of a fluorine atom at the C-6 position produces fluroquinolones, which account for a large proportion of the quinolones in clinical use. Among others, substitution of piperazine ormethylpiperazine, pyrrolidinyl and piperidinyl rings also yields effective analogues. Atotal of twenty six analogues are reported in this review. The targets of quinolones are two bacterial enzymes of the class II topoisomerase family, namely gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Quinolones increase the concentration of drug-enzyme-DNA cleavage complexes and convert them into cellular toxins; as a result they are bactericidal. High bioavailability, relative low toxicity and favorable pharmacokinetics have resulted in the clinical success of fluoroquinolones and quinolones. Due to these superior properties, quinolones have been extensively utilized and this increased usage has resulted in some quinolone-resistant bacterial strains. Bacteria become resistant to quinolones by three mechanisms: (1) mutation in the target site (gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV) of quinolones; (2) plasmid-mediated resistance; and (3) chromosome-mediated quinolone resistance. In plasmid-mediated resistance, the efflux of quinolones is increased along with a decrease in the interaction of the drug with gyrase (topoisomerase IV). In the case of chromosome-mediated quinolone resistance, there is a decrease in the influx of the drug into the cell.},

abstract = {Seventy-six faecal samples were obtained from broilers at slaughterhouse level in Portugal. Samples were inoculated on cefotaxime-supplemented Levine agar plates. Cefotaxime-resistant Escherichia coli isolates were recovered from 32 samples (42.1{\%}), obtaining a total of 34 E. coli isolates (one or two isolates per sample). Susceptibility to 16 antibiotics was studied by disk diffusion method, and 85{\%} of the isolates presented a phenotype of multi-resistance that included antimicrobial agents of at least four different families. Extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBL) of the TEM and CTX-M groups were detected in 31 ESBL-positive E. coli isolates. Twenty-six isolates harboured the bla(TEM-52) gene and two of them also harboured bla(TEM-1b). The bla(CTX-M-14) gene was identified in three isolates (in association with bla(TEM-1b) in one of them), and bla(CTX-M-32) was demonstrated in two additional isolates. Three of the 34 cefotaxime-resistant isolates (9{\%}) did not produce ESBLs, and two of them presented mutations at positions -42 (C--{\textgreater}T), -18 (G--{\textgreater}A), -1 (C--{\textgreater}T), and +58(C--{\textgreater}T) of the promoter/attenuator region of ampC gene. tet(A) and/or tet(B) genes were detected in all 34 tetracycline-resistant isolates, aadA in all 26 streptomycin-resistant isolates; cmlA in 3 of 6 chloramphenicol-resistant isolates, and aac(3)-II or aac(3)-I + aac(3)-IV genes in all 4 gentamicin-resistant isolates. Different combinations of sul1, sul2 and sul3 genes were demonstrated among the 22 trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant isolates. Amino acid changes in GyrA and ParC proteins were identified in all 18 ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates. The results of this study indicate that the intestinal tract of healthy poultry is a reservoir of ESBL-positive E. coli isolates.},

abstract = {This study explored and compared the mechanisms and selective concentration of resistance between a 3rd (pradofloxacin) and 2nd (ciprofloxacin) generation fluoroquinolone. Pradofloxacin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants were selected by stepwise exposure of Escherichia coli (E. coli) to escalating concentrations of pradofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. The sequence of the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) and the transcriptional regulator soxS were analyzed, and efflux pump AcrAB-TolC activity was measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). First-step mutants reduced the fluoroquinolone sensitivity and one mutant bore a single substitution in gyrA. Four of six second-step mutants expressed ciprofloxacin resistance, and displayed additional mutations in gyrA and/or parC, while these mutants retained susceptibility to pradofloxacin. All the third-step mutants were fluoroquinolone resistant, and each expressed multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotypes. Further, they displayed resistance to all antibacterials tested except cefotaxime, ceftazidime and meropenem. The number of mutations in QRDR of gyrA and parC correlated with fluoroquinolone MICs. Mutations in parC were not common in pradofloxacin-associated mutants. Moreover, one second- and one third-step ciprofloxacin-associated mutants bore both mutations at position 12 (Ala12Ser) and 78 (Met78Leu) in the soxS gene, yet no mutations in the soxS gene were detected in the pradofloxacin-selected mutants. Altogether, these results demonstrated that resistance emerged relatively more rapidly in 2nd compared to 3rd generation fluoroquinolones. Point mutations in gyrA were a key mechanism of resistance to pradofloxacin, and overexpression of efflux pump gene acrB played a potential role in the emergence of MDR phenotypes identified in this study.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to describe and compare the occurrence of quinolone resistant Escherichia coli (QREC) in various animal species in relation to human population density. Data from the Norwegian monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in feed, food and animals from 2006 to 2016 was compiled and analysed. In total, 4568 E. coli isolates were included in this study. The isolates originated from broilers, layers, cattle, turkeys, dogs, wild birds, red foxes, reindeer, sheep, horses and pigs. Data regarding the geographical location of sampling was obtained for 4050 of these isolates and used to categorize the isolates depending on the human population density of the area. In total, 1.4{\%} of the isolates were categorized as quinolone resistant. Compared to most European countries, there was an overall low occurrence of QREC in various animal species in Norway, though with an interspecies variation with the highest occurrence in broilers and wild birds (p {\textless} 0.05). Human population density was not associated with the occurrence of QREC. Since fluoroquinolones are not used prophylactically and in almost negligent amounts in various species in Norway, the interspecies variation in the occurrence of QREC suggests that other factors than fluoroquinolone use may be important in the development of QREC.},

abstract = {Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) causes colibacillosis, which results in significant economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. However, the diversity between isolates remains poorly understood. Here, a total of 272 APEC isolates collected from the United Kingdom (UK), Italy and Germany were characterised using multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) targeting 22 equally weighted factors covering virulence genes, R-type and phylogroup. Following these analysis, 95 of the selected strains were further analysed using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). The most prevalent phylogroups were B2 (47{\%}) and A1 (22{\%}), although there were national differences with Germany presenting group B2 (35.3{\%}), Italy presenting group A1 (53.3{\%}) and UK presenting group B2 (56.1{\%}) as the most prevalent. R-type R1 was the most frequent type (55{\%}) among APEC, but multiple R-types were also frequent (26.8{\%}). Following compilation of all the PCR data which covered a total of 15 virulence genes, it was possible to build a similarity tree using each PCR result unweighted to produce 9 distinct groups. The average number of virulence genes was 6â8 per isolate, but no positive association was found between phylogroup and number or type of virulence genes. A total of 95 isolates representing each of these 9 groupings were genome sequenced and analysed for in silico serotype, Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST), and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The UK isolates showed the greatest variability in terms of serotype and MLST compared with German and Italian isolates, whereas the lowest prevalence of AMR was found for German isolates. Similarity trees were compiled using sequencing data and notably single nucleotide polymorphism data generated ten distinct geno-groups. The frequency of geno-groups across Europe comprised 26.3{\%} belonging to Group 8 representing serogroups O2, O4, O18 and MLST types ST95, ST140, ST141, ST428, ST1618 and others, 18.9{\%} belonging to Group 1 (serogroups O78 and MLST types ST23, ST2230), 15.8{\%} belonging to Group 10 (serogroups O8, O45, O91, O125ab and variable MLST types), 14.7{\%} belonging to Group 7 (serogroups O4, O24, O35, O53, O161 and MLST type ST117) and 13.7{\%} belonging to Group 9 (serogroups O1, O16, O181 and others and MLST types ST10, ST48 and others). The other groups (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) each contained relatively few strains. However, for some of the genogroups (e.g. groups 6 and 7) partial overlap with SNPs grouping and PCR grouping (matching PCR groups 8 (13 isolates on 22) and 1 (14 isolates on 16) were observable). However, it was not possible to obtain a clear correlation between genogroups and unweighted PCR groupings. This may be due to the genome plasticity of E. coli that enables strains to carry the same virulence factors even if the overall genotype is substantially different. The conclusion to be drawn from the lack of correlations is that firstly, APEC are very diverse and secondly, it is not possible to rely on any one or more basic molecular or phenotypic tests to define APEC with clarity, reaffirming the need for whole genome analysis approaches which we describe here. This study highlights the presence of previously unreported serotypes and MLSTs for APEC in Europe. Moreover, it is a first step on a cautious reconsideration of the merits of classical identification criteria such as R typing, phylogrouping and serotyping.},

abstract = {A novel gene for quinolone resistance was cloned from a transferable plasmid carried by a clinical isolate of Shigella flexneri 2b that was resistant to fluoroquinolones. The plasmid conferred low-level resistance to quinolones on Escherichia coli HB101. The protein encoded by the gene showed 59{\%} amino acid identity with Qnr. Quinolone resistance is usually caused by mutations in the chromosomal genes for DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV, the targets of quinolones (1, 3). Plasmid-mediated resis-tance was first discovered in a clinical strain of Klebsiella pneu-moniae isolated in Alabama (5). This plasmid, pMG252, was a multiresistance-encoding plasmid and contained the gene for quinolone resistance, qnr. The qnr gene has been found to encode a 218-amino-acid protein, and the purified Qnr protein has been shown to protect DNA gyrase activity in vitro (8). The qnr gene has since been detected in more than 20 clinical strains of K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolated in the United States and China (4, 7, 10, 11). At the beginning of October 2003, an outbreak of food poisoning caused by Shigella flexneri 2b occurred in Aichi Pre-fecture, Japan. Eight clinical strains isolated from the patients were subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis for epidemiological investigation. They were judged to be clones from the same origin on the basis of the pulsed-field gel elec-trophoresis pattern obtained. We also determined the drug sensitivities of these isolates. Seven of the eight clones had the same pattern of drug resistance. However, one had additional resistance to fluoroquinolones and cephaloridine. In the course of investigating the mechanism of acquisition of the additional drug resistance, we found a plasmid carrying resis-tance genes and cloned a novel gene responsible for quinolone resistance. This is the first report of a gene for quinolone resistance on the conjugative plasmid in Shigella. Strains and drug resistance. Nine strains of S. flexneri 2b were isolated from eight patients. Strains 1 to 8 were isolated from different patients from 1 to 9 October 2003. Strains 8 and 8Ð were from the same patient and were isolated on 8 and 20 October, respectively. This patient was treated with levofloxacin. With antibiotic disks (KB disk; Eiken Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan), patterns of resistance to 12 drugs were examined. Pat-terns of seven isolates of S. flexneri 2b were the same. They were resistant to ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol (CHL), tetracycline, and nalidixic acid (NAL). However, strain 8 (and strain 8Ð) was resistant to three additional drugs, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and cephaloridine (CER). All isolates were sensi-tive to cefotaxime, fosfomycin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethox-azole. The mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining re-gion (12) of the gyrA and parC genes were examined. The quinolone resistance-determining region cloned by PCR (9) was sequenced by the IR dye terminator method with the LI-COR 4200 IR 2 system (LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebr.). The fol-lowing mutations were found in all of the isolates: Ser-83 to Leu in the gyrA gene and Ser-80 to Ile in the parC gene. Plasmid profiles and conjugation experiments. Plasmid pro-files revealed that strain 8 (and strain 8Ð) had a unique plasmid of about 47 kb that was not present in the other seven isolates. The plasmid was designated pAH0376.

@article{Bandele2008,
abstract = {Dietary polyphenols are a diverse and complex group of compounds that are linked to human health. Many of their effects have been attributed to the ability to poison (i.e., enhance DNA cleavage by) topoisomerase II. Polyphenols act against the enzyme by at least two different mechanisms. Some compounds are traditional, redox-independent topoisomerase II poisons, interacting with the enzyme in a noncovalent manner. Conversely, others enhance DNA cleavage in a redox-dependent manner that requires covalent adduction to topoisomerase II. Unfortunately, the structural elements that dictate the mechanism by which polyphenols poison topoisomerase II have not been identified. To resolve this issue, the activities of two classes of polyphenols against human topoisomerase IIalpha were examined. The first class was a catechin series, including (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), and (-)-epicatechin (EC). The second was a flavonol series, including myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol. Compounds were categorized into four distinct groups: EGCG and EGC were redox-dependent topoisomerase II poisons, kaempferol and quercetin were traditional poisons, myricetin utilized both mechanisms, and ECG and EC displayed no significant activity. On the basis of these findings, a set of rules is proposed that predicts the mechanism of bioflavonoid action against topoisomerase II. The first rule centers on the B ring. While the C4'-OH is critical for the compound to act as a traditional poison, the addition of -OH groups at C3' and C5' increases the redox activity of the B ring and allows the compound to act as a redox-dependent poison. The second rule centers on the C ring. The structure of the C ring in the flavonols is aromatic and planar and includes a C4-keto group that allows the formation of a proposed pseudo ring with the C5-OH. Disruption of these elements abrogates enzyme binding and precludes the ability to function as a traditional topoisomerase II poison.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Identification of antimicrobial resistance genes is important for understanding the underlying mechanisms and the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. As the costs of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) continue to decline, it becomes increasingly available in routine diagnostic laboratories and is anticipated to substitute traditional methods for resistance gene identification. Thus, the current challenge is to extract the relevant information from the large amount of generated data. METHODS: We developed a web-based method, ResFinder that uses BLAST for identification of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in whole-genome data. As input, the method can use both pre-assembled, complete or partial genomes, and short sequence reads from four different sequencing platforms. The method was evaluated on 1862 GenBank files containing 1411 different resistance genes, as well as on 23 de-novo-sequenced isolates. RESULTS: When testing the 1862 GenBank files, the method identified the resistance genes with an ID = 100{\%} (100{\%} identity) to the genes in ResFinder. Agreement between in silico predictions and phenotypic testing was found when the method was further tested on 23 isolates of five different bacterial species, with available phenotypes. Furthermore, ResFinder was evaluated on WGS chromosomes and plasmids of 30 isolates. Seven of these isolates were annotated to have antimicrobial resistance, and in all cases, annotations were compatible with the ResFinder results. CONCLUSIONS: A web server providing a convenient way of identifying acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in completely sequenced isolates was created. ResFinder can be accessed at www.genomicepidemiology.org. ResFinder will continuously be updated as new resistance genes are identified.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The recent flood of data from genome sequences and functional genomics has given rise to new field, bioinformatics, which combines elements of biology and computer science. OBJECTIVES Here we propose a definition for this new field and review some of the research that is being pursued, particularly in relation to transcriptional regulatory systems. METHODS Our definition is as follows: Bioinformatics is conceptualizing biology in terms of macromolecules (in the sense of physical-chemistry) and then applying "informatics" techniques (derived from disciplines such as applied maths, computer science, and statistics) to understand and organize the information associated with these molecules, on a large-scale. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Analyses in bioinformatics predominantly focus on three types of large datasets available in molecular biology: macromolecular structures, genome sequences, and the results of functional genomics experiments (e.g. expression data). Additional information includes the text of scientific papers and "relationship data" from metabolic pathways, taxonomy trees, and protein-protein interaction networks. Bioinformatics employs a wide range of computational techniques including sequence and structural alignment, database design and data mining, macromolecular geometry, phylogenetic tree construction, prediction of protein structure and function, gene finding, and expression data clustering. The emphasis is on approaches integrating a variety of computational methods and heterogeneous data sources. Finally, bioinformatics is a practical discipline. We survey some representative applications, such as finding homologues, designing drugs, and performing large-scale censuses. Additional information pertinent to the review is available over the web at http://bioinfo.mbb.yale.edu/what-is-it.},

With ciprofloxacin and other quinolones, the inhibition of DNA supercoiling, relaxation, and decatenation and the induction of DNA cleavage were investigated for both wild-type and mutant enzymes. In each assay, the mutant enzymes were found to require approximately 10 times more drug to inhibit the reaction or induce cleavage than was the wild-type enzyme.

abstract = {Studies with fluoroquinolones have led to a general method for restricting the selection of antibiotic-resistant mutants. The strategy is based on the use of antibiotic concentrations that require cells to obtain 2 concurrent resistance mutations for growth. That concentration has been called the "mutant prevention concentration" (MPC) because no resistant colony is recovered even when {\textgreater}10(10) cells are plated. Resistant mutants are selected exclusively within a concentration range (mutant selection window) that extends from the point where growth inhibition begins, approximated by the minimal inhibitory concentration, up to the MPC. The dimensions of the mutant selection window can be reduced in a variety of ways, including adjustment of antibiotic structure and dosage regimens. The window can be closed to prevent mutant selection through combination therapy with {\textgreater} or =2 antimicrobial agents if their normalized pharmacokinetic profiles superimpose at concentrations that inhibit growth. Application of these principles could drastically restrict the selection of drug-resistant pathogens.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Feed contaminated with Salmonella spp. constitutes a risk of Salmonella infections in animals, and subsequently in the consumers of animal products. Salmonella are occasionally isolated from the feed factory environment and some clones of Salmonella persist in the factory environment for several years. One hypothesis is that biofilm formation facilitates persistence by protecting bacteria against environmental stress, e.g. disinfection. The aim of this study was to investigate the biofilm forming potential of Salmonella strains from feed- and fishmeal factories. The study included 111 Salmonella strains isolated from Norwegian feed and fish meal factories in the period 1991-2006 of serovar Agona, serovar Montevideo, serovar Senftenberg and serovar Typhimurium. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between serovars regarding the abilities to form biofilm on polystyrene (microtiter plate assay) and in the air-liquid interface of nutrient broth (pellicle assay). Strains of serovar Agona and serovar Montevideo were good biofilm producers. In Norwegian factories, clones of these serovars have been observed to persist for several years. Most serovar Senftenberg clones appear to persist for a shorter period, and strains of this serovar were medium biofilm producers in our test systems. Strains of the serovar Typhimurium were relatively poor biofilm producers. Salmonella ser. Typhimurium clones have not been observed to persist even though this serovar is resident in Norwegian wild life. When classifying strains according to persistence or presumed non-persistence, persistent strains produced more biofilm than presumed non-persisting strains. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a correlation between persistence and biofilm formation which suggests that biofilm forming ability may be an important factor for persistence of Salmonella in the factory environment.},

One hundred fifty-three retail foods including chicken meat, beef, pork, and vegetables were purchased from 29 supermarkets between January and October in 2010. ESBL producers were recovered from each food sample using McConkey agar plate supplemented with 1 mg/L of cefotaxime. ESBL type was identified by DNA sequencing analysis after polymerase chain reaction amplification. Antibiogram, O serotype, plasmid replicon type, pulsotype, and multilocus sequence type were also determined. Fifty-two epidemiologically unrelated Escherichia coli isolates producing ESBL were recovered from 35 (22.9{\%}) of 153 samples, all of which were chicken meat. ESBL types were mainly CTX-M-2 group followed by CTX-M-1 group and CTX-M-8 group. The numbers of bacterial isolates (8 of 21, 38.1{\%}) harboring bla(CTX-M-8) recovered from imported meat samples were significantly larger than those of domestic ones (one of 31, 3.2{\%}) (p{\textless}0.05). Nine O serotypes (mainly O8, O25, and O1) were found, together with O-antigen untypable (OUT). Four E. coli belonging to the O25b:H4-ST131 clone were recovered from domestic (n=1) and imported meat samples (n=3), respectively. These four isolates were susceptible to fluoroquinolones, although the E. coli O25b:H4-ST131 clone producing CTX-M-15, which is predominant in human isolates, is usually resistant to fluoroquinolones. By contrast, five CTX-M-15-producing E. coli strains were recovered only from domestic meat samples, and their serotypes were O8 or OUT instead of predominant serotype O25b. Our results showed that ESBL-producing E. coli isolates recovered from retail chicken meat samples in Japan are generally divergent in both genetic and serological aspects. Further comparative analyses of bla(CTX-M)-mediating genetic elements would be continued in the next step to characterize the ESBL producers from retail foods in Japan.},

We report a direct link between this system and the ubiquitous SOS response. We found that LexA controlled expression of most integron integrases and consequently regulated cassette recombination. This regulatory coupling enhanced the potential for cassette swapping and capture in cells under stress, while minimizing cassette rearrangements or loss in constant environments. This finding exposes integrons as integrated adaptive systems and has implications for antibiotic treatment policies.},

Among stop codons UAG is cleaved with fast, UAA intermediate and UGA slow rate, while UCG and CAG are cleaved most rapidly among sense codons.

@article{Pietsch2017a,
abstract = {Objectives Resistance to the fluoroquinolone drug ciprofloxacin is commonly linked to mutations that alter the drug target or increase drug efflux via the major AcrAB-TolC transporter. Very little is known about other mutations that might also reduce susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. We discovered that an Escherichia coli strain experimentally evolved for resistance to ciprofloxacin had acquired a mutation in rpoB, the gene coding for the $\beta$-subunit of RNA polymerase. The aim of this work was to determine whether this mutation, and other mutations in rpoB, contribute to ciprofloxacin resistance and, if so, by which mechanism.Methods Independent lineages of E. coli were evolved in the presence of ciprofloxacin and clones from endpoint cultures were screened for mutations in rpoB. Ciprofloxacin-selected rpoB mutations were identified and characterized in terms of effects on susceptibility and mode of action.Results Mutations in rpoB were selected at a high frequency in 3 out of 10 evolved lineages, in each case arising after the occurrence of mutations affecting topoisomerases and drug efflux. All ciprofloxacin-selected rpoB mutations had a high fitness cost in the absence of drug, but conferred a competitive advantage in the presence of ciprofloxacin. RNA sequencing and quantitative RTâPCR analysis showed that expression of mdtK, encoding a multidrug efflux transporter, was significantly increased by the ciprofloxacin-selected rpoB mutations. The susceptibility phenotype was shown to depend on the presence of an active mdtK and a mutant rpoB allele.Conclusions These data identify mutations in RNA polymerase as novel contributors to the evolution of resistance to ciprofloxacin and show that the phenotype is mediated by increased MdtK-dependent drug efflux.},

abstract = {This study analyzed antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and resistance genes in generic Escherichia coli isolated from retail meat samples purchased (2007-2008) in Alberta, Canada, and determined potential associations between resistance phenotypes and resistance genes with relation to the meat types. A total of 422 E. coli isolates from retail chicken, turkey, beef, and pork meats were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. Multiplex PCRs were used to detect major resistance genes for tetracyclines [tet(A), tet(B), tet(C)], sulfonamides (sul1, sul2, sul3), aminoglycosides (strA/B, aadA, aadB, aac(3)IV, aphA1, aphA2), and beta-lactamase (bla(CMY-2), bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(PSE-1)). Resistance to ciprofloxacin was not found in any isolate. Overall resistances to clinically important antimicrobials amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (16.8{\%} of isolates) and ceftriaxone (12.6{\%} isolates) were observed. These resistances were observed more frequently (p{\textless}0.0001) in chicken-derived E. coli than those from the other meat types. Resistance to multiple antimicrobials ({\textgreater}/= 5) was found in more chicken derived E. coli (32{\%}) than E. coli from other meat types. The beta-lactamase genes of clinical importance, including bla(CMY-2) and bla(TEM), were found in about 18{\%} of poultry-derived E. coli and in only 5{\%} of ground beef. The bla(CMY-2) gene was more likely to be found in E. coli from chicken than turkey, beef, or pork meats. The tet(A) gene was associated with bla(CMY-2), whereas bla(CMY-2) and bla(TEM) genes were associated with strA/B genes. Resistance genes for tetracycline, sulfonamides, and aminoglycosides were associated with the phenotypic expression of resistance to unrelated classes of antimicrobials. These data suggest the prevalence of AMR and select resistance genes were higher in poultry-derived E. coli. The multiple associations found between AMR phenotypes and resistance genes suggest a complex nature of resistance in E. coli from retail meat, and hence the use of a single antimicrobial could result in the selection of resistant E. coli not only to the drug being used but to other unrelated classes of antimicrobials as well.},

abstract = {To determine the prevalence of extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL) production in Enterobacteriaceae in retail chicken meat in Germany. A total of 399 chicken meat samples from nine supermarket chains, four organic food stores and one butchers shop in two geographically distinct regions (Berlin and Greifswald) were screened for ESBL production using selective agar. Phenotypic ESBL isolates were tested for bla(TEM), bla(CTX-M) and bla(SHV) genes using PCR and DNA sequencing. Antibiotic coresistances were determined and strain typing was performed using PCR-based phylogenetic grouping and XbaI-PFGE. A total of 185 confirmed ESBL isolates were obtained from 175 samples (43.9) from all tested sources. The majority of isolates were Escherichia coli producing ESBL types SHV-12 (n82), CTX-M-1 (n77) and TEM-52 (n16). No differences could be observed in the prevalence of ESBL producers between organic and conventional samples. 73.0 of the ESBL producers showed coresistance to tetracycline, 35.7 to co-trimoxazole and 7.6 to ciprofloxacin. Strain typing of selected E. coli isolates from Berlin revealed identical macrorestriction patterns for several isolates from samples taken from the same stores. This is the first comprehensive study from Germany showing a high prevalence of TEM-, CTX-M- and SHV-type ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from retail chicken meat. The high rate of coresistance to different classes of antibiotics in the ESBL producers might reflect the common veterinary usage of these and related substances. There is an urgent need to further evaluate the role of poultry in the transmission of highly resistant ESBL-producing bacteria in humans.},

Coliforms are a group of lactose-fermenting Enterobacteriaceae, which most likely acquired the lacZ gene by horizontal transfer and therefore constitute a polyphyletic group. Among this group of bacteria is Escherichia coli, the pathogen that is most frequently associated with foodborne disease outbreaks and is often identified by $\beta$-glucuronidase enzymatic activity or by the redundant detection of uidA by PCR. Because a significant fraction of essential E. coli genes are preserved throughout the bacterial kingdom, alternative oligonucleotide primers for specific E. coli detection are not easily identified.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In this manuscript, two strategies were used to design oligonucleotide primers with differing levels of specificity for the simultaneous detection of total coliforms and E. coli by multiplex PCR. A consensus sequence of lacZ and the orphan gene yaiO were chosen as targets for amplification, yielding 234 bp and 115 bp PCR products, respectively.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The assay designed in this work demonstrated superior detection ability when tested with lab collection and dairy isolated lactose-fermenting strains. While lacZ amplicons were found in a wide range of coliforms, yaiO amplification was highly specific for E. coli. Additionally, yaiO detection is non-redundant with enzymatic methods.},

In this Review, we discuss the ecology of antibiotics and the ability of subinhibitory concentrations to select for bacterial resistance. We also consider the effects of low-level drug exposure on bacterial physiology, including the generation of genetic and phenotypic variability, as well as the ability of antibiotics to function as signalling molecules.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Two quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and five quinolone-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were used to obtain in-vitro quinolone-resistant mutants in a multistep resistance selection process. The fluoroquinolones used were ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, gemifloxacin, trovafloxacin and clinafloxacin. The mutagenicity of these quinolones was determined by the Salmonella and the Escherichia coli retromutation assays. All quinolone-resistant Staph. aureus mutants had at least one mutation in the grlA gene, while 86.6{\%} of quinolone-resistant Strep. pneumoniae mutants had mutations in either or both the gyrA and parC genes. Moxifloxacin and levofloxacin selected resistant mutants later than the other quinolones, but this difference was more obvious in Staph. aureus. Accumulation of the fluoroquinolones by Staph. aureus did not explain these differences, since levofloxacin and moxifloxacin accumulated inside bacteria to the same extent as clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin. The results also showed that moxifloxacin and levofloxacin had less mutagenic potency in both mutagenicity assays, suggesting a possible relationship between the selection of resistance to quinolones and the mutagenic potency of the molecule. Furthermore, gemifloxacin selected efflux mutants more frequently than the other quinolones used. Thus, the risk of developing quinolone resistance may depend on the density of the microorganism at the infection site and the concentration of the fluoroquinolone, and also on the mutagenicity of the quinolone used, with moxifloxacin and levofloxacin being the least mutagenic.},

@article{Strand2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The problem of emerging ciprofloxacin resistance is compounded by its frequent association with multiresistance, the reason for which is not fully understood. In this study we compare multiresistance, clonal similarities and phylogenetic group in urinary tract isolates of Escherichia coli sensitive and resistant to the quinolone antimicrobials nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. RESULTS: Quinolone resistant isolates were more resistant to non-quinolone antibiotics than sensitive isolates, with resistance to ampicillin, mecillinam, sulphonamide, trimethoprim, tetracycline, kanamycin and chloramphenicol significantly increased. Fifty-one percent of quinolone-resistant isolates were multiresistant. Although multiresistance was most prevalent (63{\%}) in isolates showing high-level ciprofloxacin resistance, it was still highly prevalent (41{\%}) in nalidixic acid resistant isolates with low-level ciprofloxacin resistance. Multiresistance was more frequent among singleton isolates (61{\%}) than clonal isolates (40{\%}) of quinolone resistant Escherichia coli. Ciprofloxacin resistance was associated with certain specific clones, among them the globally distributed clonal Group A. However, there was no significant difference in the overall degree of clonality between quinolone sensitive and resistant isolates. Ciprofloxacin resistance was positively associated with phylogroup D and negatively associated with phylogroup B2. This correlation was not associated with clonal isolates. CONCLUSION: This study supports earlier findings of association between ciprofloxacin resistance and resistance to other antibiotics. The prevalence of multiresistance in quinolone-resistant isolates that have not yet developed high-level ciprofloxacin resistance suggest that multiresistance arises early in the development of quinolone resistance. This is consistent with exposure to quinolones causing quinolone resistance by mutations and mobilization of multiresistance elements by induction of the SOS response. The spread of clones seems to be less important than previously reported in regard to emergence of quinolone resistance and multiresistance as both are associated primarily with singleton isolates.},

abstract = {The relationship between rates of genomic evolution and organismal adaptation remains uncertain, despite considerable interest. The feasibility of obtaining genome sequences from experimentally evolving populations offers the opportunity to investigate this relationship with new precision. Here we sequence genomes sampled through 40,000 generations from a laboratory population of Escherichia coli. Although adaptation decelerated sharply, genomic evolution was nearly constant for 20,000 generations. Such clock-like regularity is usually viewed as the signature of neutral evolution, but several lines of evidence indicate that almost all of these mutations were beneficial. This same population later evolved an elevated mutation rate and accumulated hundreds of additional mutations dominated by a neutral signature. Thus, the coupling between genomic and adaptive evolution is complex and can be counterintuitive even in a constant environment. In particular, beneficial substitutions were surprisingly uniform over time, whereas neutral substitutions were highly variable.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Predicting antibiotic resistance before it emerges at clinical settings constitutes a novel approach for preventing and fighting resistance of bacterial pathogens. To analyse the possibility that novel plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance determinants (Qnr) can emerge and disseminate among bacterial pathogens, we searched the presence of those elements in nearly 1000 bacterial genomes and metagenomes. RESULTS: We have found a number of novel potential qnr genes in the chromosomes of aquatic bacteria and in metagenomes from marine organisms. Functional studies of the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Smqnr gene show that plasmid-encoded SmQnr confers quinolone resistance upon its expression in a heterologous host. CONCLUSION: Altogether, the data presented in our work support the notion that predictive studies on antibiotic resistance are feasible, using currently available information on bacterial genomes and with the aid of bioinformatic and functional tools. Our results confirm that aquatic bacteria can be the origin of plasmid-encoded Qnr, and highlight the potential role of S. maltophilia as a source of novel Qnr determinants.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli is familiar to biologists as a classical model system, ubiquitous in molecular biology laboratories around the world. Outside of the laboratory, E. coli strains exist as an almost universal component of the lower-gut flora of humans and animals. Although usually a commensal, E. coli has an alter ego as a pathogen, and is associated with diarrhoeal disease and extra-intestinal infections. The study of E. coli diversity predates the availability of molecular data, with strains initially distinguished by serotyping and metabolic profiling, and genomic diversity illustrated by DNA hybridisation. The quantitative study of E. coli diversity began with the application of multi-locus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE), and has progressed with the accumulation of nucleotide sequence data, from single genes through multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) to whole genome sequencing. Phylogenetic methods have shed light on the processes of genomic evolution in this extraordinarily diverse species, and revealed the origins of pathogenic E. coli strains, including members of the phylogenetically indistinguishable " genus" Shigella. In May and June 2011, an outbreak of haemorrhagic uraemic syndrome in Germany was linked to a strain of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O104:H4. Application of high-throughput sequencing technologies allowed the genome and origins of the outbreak strain to be characterised in real time as the outbreak was in progress. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The sources comprised prospectively collected E. coli isolates from women with urinary tract infection (UTI) (n = 353); retail meat (n = 417); and restaurant/ready-to-eat foods (n = 74).

E. coli from retail chicken (O25:H4-ST131 and O114:H4-ST117) and honeydew melon (O2:H7-ST95) were indistinguishable from or closely related to E. coli from human UTIs.

@article{Barnard2001,
abstract = {DNA gyrase is a target of quinolone antibacterial agents, but the molecular details of the quinolone-gyrase interaction are not clear. Quinolone resistance mutations frequently occur at residues Ser(83) and Asp(87) of the gyrase A subunit, suggesting that these residues are involved in drug binding. Single and double alanine substitutions were created at these positions (Ala(83), Ala(87), and Ala(83) Ala(87)), and the mutant proteins were assessed for DNA supercoiling, DNA cleavage, and resistance to a number of quinolone drugs. The Ala(83) mutant was fully active in supercoiling, whereas the Ala(87) and the double mutant were 2.5- and 4- to 5-fold less active, respectively; this loss in activity may be partly due to an increased affinity of these mutant proteins for DNA. Supercoiling inhibition and cleavage assays revealed that the double mutant has a high level of resistance to certain quinolones while the mutants with single alanine substitutions show low-level resistance. Using a drug-binding assay we demonstrated that the double-mutant enzyme-DNA complex has a lower affinity for ciprofloxacin than the wild-type complex. Based on the pattern of resistance to a series of quinolones, an interaction between the C-8 group of the quinolone and the double-mutant gyrase in the region of residues 83 and 87 is proposed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to study the genetic determinants responsible for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) resistance of Salmonella isolated from Dutch poultry, poultry meat and hospitalized humans. METHODS: Thirty-four ESBL-resistant Salmonella isolates from The Netherlands were tested towards 21 antimicrobial agents. PCR and sequencing were used to determine the underlying genetic determinants responsible for the ESBL phenotypes. The transferability of the ESBL phenotypes was tested by conjugation to a susceptible Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin and plasmid purification, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were employed to further characterize a subset of the isolates. RESULTS: A great genetic diversity was seen among the isolates. The bla(TEM-52) gene was most predominant and was found among Salmonella enterica serovars Blockley, Thomson, London, Enteritidis phage type 14b, Paratyphi B, Virchow and Typhimurium phage types 11 and 507. We also found the bla(TEM-20) gene in S. Paratyphi B var. Java and the bla(TEM-63) gene in S. Isangi. Furthermore, we detected the bla(CTX-M-28) gene in S. Isangi and the bla(CTX-M-3) gene in S. Typhimurium phage type 507. The bla(CTX-M-2) gene was identified in S. Virchow, which also contained a copy of the bla(SHV-2) gene and a copy of the bla(TEM-1) gene. The bla(SHV-12) gene was found alone in S. Concord and together with the bla(TEM-52) gene in S. Typhimurium. Finally, the bla(ACC-1) gene was cloned from a S. Bareilly isolate and was found to be present on indistinguishable plasmids in all S. Bareilly isolates examined as well as in a S. Braenderup isolate and a S. Infantis isolate. CONCLUSIONS: Our data underscore the diversity of ESBL genes in Salmonella enterica isolated from animals, food products and human patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Previously 14 conjugative plasmids from multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli from healthy humans and food-producing animals in Switzerland were sequenced. The aim of this study was to extend the genetic characterization of these plasmids with a focus on bla ESBL genes including bla CTX-M-1 and bla TEM, class 1 integrons and toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems contained therein. METHODS: The nucleotide sequences and subsequent annotation therein of 14 conjugative plasmids were previously determined from their corresponding transconjugants. The TA loci were confirmed by RASTA-Bacteria. RESULTS: Eight of the conjugative plasmids identified were found to encode genes expressing ESBLs. Structural heterogeneity was noted in the regions flanking both the bla CTX-M-1 and bla TEM genes. The bla CTX-M-1 genes were associated with the common insertion sequences ISEcp1 and IS26, and uniquely with an IS5 element in one case; while bla TEM genes were found to be associated with IS26 and Tn2. A new bla TEM-210 gene was identified. Seven class 1 integrons were also identified and assigned into 3 groups, denoted as In54, In369 and In501. Sixteen TA loci belonging to 4 of the TA gene families (relBE, vapBC, ccd and mazEF) were identified on 11 of these plasmids. CONCLUSIONS: Comparative sequence analysis of these plasmids provided data on the structures likely to contribute to sequence diversity associated with these accessory genes, including IS26, ISEcp1 and Tn2. All of them contribute to the dissemination of the corresponding resistance genes located on the different plasmids. There appears to be no association between beta-lactam encoding genes and TA systems.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the clonal structure, antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and their determinants among early vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREm) isolates in Poland. Two hundred and eighty-one VREm isolates collected between 1997 and 2005 were studied. VREm isolates were characterised by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The presence of antimicrobial resistance determinants, transposon-specific genes, IS16 and esp Efm was checked by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ciprofloxacin and ampicillin resistance determinants were investigated by sequencing. Two hundred and twenty-two (79 {\%}) and 59 (21 {\%}) VREm isolates were vanA- and vanB-positive, respectively. Among 135 representative isolates, MLST yielded 33 different sequence types (STs), of which 29 were characteristic of hospital-associated E. faecium; 128 (94.8 {\%}) and 123 (91.1 {\%}) isolates harboured the IS16 and esp Efm genes, and all 135 isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and ampicillin. Resistance to tetracycline (71.1 {\%} isolates) was mostly associated with tetM (75.0 {\%}) and the concomitant presence of the Tn916 integrase gene. High-level resistance to streptomycin (93.3 {\%} of isolates) and high-level resistance to gentamicin (94.1 {\%} of isolates) were due to ant(6')-Ia and aac(6')-Ie-aph(2â³) genes, respectively, the latter of which is known to be located on various Tn4001-type transposons. Fifteen combinations of mutations in the quinolone-determining regions of GyrA and ParC were identified, including changes not previously reported, such as S83F and A84P in GyrA. Twenty-three variants of the penicillin-binding protein PBP5 occurred in the studied group, and novel insertions at amino acid positions 433 and 568 were identified. This analysis revealed the predominance of hospital-associated strains of E. faecium, carrying an abundant and divergent range of resistance determinants among early VREm isolates in Poland.},

@article{Barton1995,
abstract = {We have devised a method for detecting and estimating the sizes of large bacterial plasmids in the presence of genomic DNA by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Bacteria harboring plasmids were embedded in agarose and lysed using a rapid protocol. Plugs were incubated with S1 nuclease and subjected to PFGE in agarose gels. S1 nuclease converted supercoiled plasmids into full-length linear molecules. Large plasmids migrated as discrete bands that were readily observed after ethidium staining. Their sizes were reliably estimated by comparison with linear DNA markers. Without S1 digestion, supercoiled plasmids migrated at rates that were not a simple function of their molecular weights, making size determinations problematic. S1-PFGE detected megaplasmids up to 609 kilobases (kb) in six genera of bacteria (Agrobacterium, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus). The procedure gave size values consistent with previous estimates for characterized megaplasmids. Eight new plasmids between 102 and 316 kb were discovered in Klebsiella and Staphylococcus. S1-PFGE avoids the difficulties of plasmid isolation, eliminates the preparation of probes, and does not require knowledge of restriction enzyme cleavage sites. It detects multiple large plasmids up to the limits of PFGE and can be used to screen for megaplasmids in many strains simultaneously.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli at the different levels of the Norwegian broiler production pyramid and identify the mechanisms responsible for the resistance phenotype. Samples from all levels of the broiler production pyramid and retail chicken meat (fillets) were included (n=649). The occurrence of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli at the different production levels ranged from 8 to 43{\%}. All these isolates had an AmpC-phenotype, and the majority carried the blaCMY-2 gene. In addition, a few isolates with up-regulated chromosomal ampC were identified. The results show that Norway has a relatively high prevalence of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in the broiler production chain in spite of a very low consumption of antimicrobial agents. Cephalosporins have not been used in the Norwegian broiler production, and it has been hypothesised that import of breeding animals and hatching eggs may be the source of these resistant bacteria. We demonstrate that these bacteria are disseminated in the production pyramid despite the lack of selection pressure from antimicrobial agents.},

abstract = {Quinolone-resistant clinical Escherichia coli isolates were examined for mutations in the marRAB operon of the multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) locus. Among 23 strains evaluated, 8 were chosen for further study: 3 that showed relatively high levels of uninduced, i.e., constitutive, expression of the operon and 5 with variable responses to induction by salicylate or tetracyclines. The marR genes, specifying the repressor of the operon, cloned from the three strains constitutively expressing the operon did not reduce the level of expression of beta-galactosidase from a marO::lacZ transcriptional fusion and were therefore mutant; however, marR genes cloned from the five other clinical strains repressed LacZ expression and were wild type. All three mutant marR genes contained more than one mutation: a deletion and a point mutation. Inactivation of the mar locus in the three known marR mutant strains with a kanamycin resistance cassette introduced by homologous recombination reduced resistance to quinolones and multiple antibiotics. These findings indicate that mar operon mutations exist in quinolone-resistant clinical E. coli isolates and contribute to quinolone and multidrug resistance.},

abstract = {Although E. coli is primarily a commensal of mammals, and to a lesser extent birds, it can be isolated from a variety of host species as well as soil, sediments, and water. It has long been recognized that E. coli exhibits quite extensive substructuring and that the relative abundance of the most common phylo-groups varies with respect to host age and sex, host species, as well as geographical location. Strains belonging to some phylo-groups are much more frequently encountered in water samples than strains belonging to other phylo-groups. The extent to which strain survival in the external environment has determined the evolutionary origins of the various diarrheal pathotypes is unknown. There is a growing body of evidence that indicates commensal E. coli, like the diarrheal pathotypes, exhibits at some tissue specificity within the gastrointestinal tract. However, there is little evidence to suggest that commensal E. coli exhibit extensive host specificity as is the case with many of the diarrheal pathotypes.},

abstract = {Sixty extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli isolated from rivers and lakes in Switzerland were screened for individual strains additionally exhibiting a reduced quinolone susceptibility phenotype. Totally, 42 such isolates were found and further characterized for their molecular (fluoro)quinolone resistance mechanisms. PCR and sequence analysis were performed to identify chromosomal mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE and to describe the occurrence of the following plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes: qepA, aac-6'-Ib-cr, qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD and qnrS. The contribution of efflux pumps to the resistance phenotype of selected strains was further determined by the broth microdilution method in the presence and absence of the efflux pump inhibitor phe-arg-beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN). Almost all strains, except two isolates, showed at least one mutation in the QRDR of gyrA. Ten strains showed only one mutation in gyrA, whereas thirty isolates exhibited up to four mutations in the QRDR of gyrA, parC and/or parE. No mutations were detected in gyrB. Most frequently the amino-acid substitution Ser83--{\textgreater}Leu was detected in GyrA followed by Asp87--{\textgreater}Asn in GyrA, Ser80--{\textgreater}Ile in ParC, Glu84--{\textgreater}Val in ParC and Ser458--{\textgreater}Ala in ParE. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance mechanisms were found in twenty isolates bearing QnrS1 (4/20), AAC-6'-Ib-cr (15/20) and QepA (1/20) determinants, respectively. No qnrA, qnrB, qnrC and qnrD were found. In the presence of PAbetaN, the MICs of nalidixic acid were decreased 4- to 32-fold. (Fluoro) quinolone resistance is due to various mechanisms frequently associated with ESBL-production in E. coli from surface waters in Switzerland.},

@article{Kozak2009,
abstract = {Wild animals not normally exposed to antimicrobial agents can acquire antimicrobial agent-resistant bacteria through contact with humans and domestic animals and through the environment. In this study we assessed the frequency of antimicrobial resistance in generic Escherichia coli isolates from wild small mammals (mice, voles, and shrews) and the effect of their habitat (farm or natural area) on antimicrobial resistance. Additionally, we compared the types and frequency of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli isolates from swine on the same farms from which wild small mammals were collected. Animals residing in the vicinity of farms were five times more likely to carry E. coli isolates with tetracycline resistance determinants than animals living in natural areas; resistance to tetracycline was also the most frequently observed resistance in isolates recovered from swine (83{\%}). Our results suggest that E. coli isolates from wild small mammals living on farms have higher rates of resistance and are more frequently multiresistant than E. coli isolates from environments, such as natural areas, that are less impacted by human and agricultural activities. No Salmonella isolates were recovered from any of the wild small mammal feces. This study suggests that close proximity to food animal agriculture increases the likelihood that E. coli isolates from wild animals are resistant to some antimicrobials, possibly due to exposure to resistant E. coli isolates from livestock, to the resistance genes of these isolates, or to antimicrobials through contact with animal feed.},

Combined data on antimicrobial consumption and corresponding resistance in animals and humans for EU MSs and reporting countries were analysed using logistic regression models for selected combinations of bacteria and antimicrobials. A summary indicator of the proportion of resistant bacteria in the main food-producing animal species was calculated for the analysis, as consumption data in food-producing animals were not available at the species level. Comparison of antimicrobial consumption data in animals and humans in 2012, both expressed in milligrams per kilogram of estimated biomass, revealed that overall antimicrobial consumption was higher in animals than in humans, although contrasting situations were observed between countries. The consumption of several antimicrobials extensively used in animal husbandry was higher in animals than in humans, while consumption of antimicrobials critically important for human medicine (such as fluoroquinolones and 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporins) was higher in humans. In both humans and animals, positive associations between consumption of antimicrobials and the corresponding resistance in bacteria were observed for most of the combinations investigated. In some cases, a positive association was also found between antimicrobial consumption in animals and resistance in bacteria from humans. While highlighting findings of concern, these results should be interpreted with caution owing to current data limitations and the complexity of the AMR phenomenon, which is influenced by several factors besides antimicrobial consumption. Recommendations to address current data limitations for analyses of this type were identified. In any case, responsible use of antimicrobials in both humans and animals should be promoted.},

The antitoxins neutralize the cognate toxins by forming tight complexes with them. The antitoxins are unstable due to degradation by cellular proteases (Lon or Clp), whereas the toxins are stable. Here we show that orf7 (denoted relBP307) and orf6 (denoted relEP307) of Escherichia coli plasmid P307 are homologous to the relBE genes of E. coli and constitute a two-component toxin-antitoxin system: (i) relEP307 encodes a cytotoxin lethal or inhibitory to host cells; (ii) relBP307 encodes an antitoxin that prevents the lethal action of the relE-encoded toxin; (iii) RelBP307 antitoxin is degraded by Lon protease; (iv) RelBP307 antitoxin autoregulates the relBE operon of P307 at the level of transcription; (v) RelEP307 toxin acts as a co-repressor of transcription; and (vi) the relBE system stabilizes a mini-P307 replicon by the killing of plasmid-free cells. Using database searching, we found relBE homologues on the chromosomes of many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Even more surprising, numerous relBE-homologous gene systems are present on the chromosomes of Archae. Thus, toxin-antitoxin systems homologous with relBE of E. coli are ubiquitous in prokaryotic organisms.},

Among the 107 E. coli isolates derived from urinary samples (59 from dogs, 40 from cats), eight isolates from four different animals (two dogs, two cats) were found to be ESBL-producers. These isolates were of ST533/CTX-M-15/TEM/phylogroup B1 (four strains from one dog), ST410/CTX-M-15/TEM/phylogroup A (three strains, one from a dog and two from a cat), and ST648/CTX-M-15/phylogroup D (one strain from a cat). In terms of putative virulence factors, all isolates harbored lpfA, sat, and tsh, whereas iss was only detected in strains of ST533. Thus, ESBL-producers were detected among uropathogenic E. coli from Swiss companion animals and the eight CTX-M-15-producing isolates belonged to three sequence types (ST410, ST533, ST648) and three E. coli phylogroups (A, B1, D).

abstract = {The prevalence of qnr genes was investigated in veterinary clinical isolates of Escherichia coli in Guangdong province, China, and the aac (6â²)-Ib gene and the mutations in QRDRs of gyrase and topoisomerase IV were examined in qnr-positive strains. A total of 232 E. coli strains isolated from pig and poultry were screened for the presence of the qnrA, qnrB and qnrS genes by PCR and sequencing. The aac (6â²)-Ib gene was detected in qnr-bearing strains by PCR and sequencing. For all strains carrying qnr, MICs for six quinolones were determined. Mutations within the gyrase and topoisomerase were analyzed by PCR and sequencing for all the QRDRs of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE. Among 232 E. coli isolates, 14 (6{\%}) isolates were positive for the qnr gene, including one for qnrB, 13 for qnrS, but no qnrA was identified in this population. Detection of the aac (6â²)-Ib gene showed that one qnrS-positive isolate from pig and one qnrB-positive isolate from duck carried aac (6â²)-Ib gene, and both were the cr variant allele of aac (6â²)-Ib. All of the 14 isolates had MICs of ciprofloxacin more than 0.25 mg/L. Mutations in the QRDR of gyrA mutations were observed in 5 (35.7{\%}) of the 14 strains. Three fluoroquinolone-resisting strains showed one mutation S83L of gyrA, while one S83I. One high-level resistance strains harboured gyrA S83L and A87N of gyrA. A singe mutation in site 58 of parC was detected in 3 (21.4{\%}) strains. None mutations were found in QRDRs of gyrB and parE. The emergence of qnr genes in veterinary clinical E. coli isolates is described for the first time. This is also the first report of aac (6â²)-Ib-cr gene in E. coli isolates from food-producing animals. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Aldred2014,
abstract = {Although quinolones have been in clinical use for decades, the mechanism underlying drug activity and resistance has remained elusive. However, recent studies indicate that clinically relevant quinolones interact with Bacillus anthracis (Gram-positive) topoisomerase IV through a critical water-metal ion bridge and that the most common quinolone resistance mutations decrease drug activity by disrupting this bridge. As a first step toward determining whether the water-metal ion bridge is a general mechanism of quinolone-topoisomerase interaction, we characterized drug interactions with wild-type Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) topoisomerase IV and a series of ParC enzymes with mutations (S80L, S80I, S80F, and E84K) in the predicted bridge-anchoring residues. Results strongly suggest that the water-metal ion bridge is essential for quinolone activity against E. coli topoisomerase IV. Although the bridge represents a common and critical mechanism that underlies broad-spectrum quinolone function, it appears to play different roles in B. anthracis and E. coli topoisomerase IV. The water-metal ion bridge is the most important binding contact of clinically relevant quinolones with the Gram-positive enzyme. However, it primarily acts to properly align clinically relevant quinolones with E. coli topoisomerase IV. Finally, even though ciprofloxacin is unable to increase levels of DNA cleavage mediated by several of the Ser80 and Glu84 mutant E. coli enzymes, the drug still retains the ability to inhibit the overall catalytic activity of these topoisomerase IV proteins. Inhibition parallels drug binding, suggesting that the presence of the drug in the active site is sufficient to diminish DNA relaxation rates.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES To assess the effectiveness of bioinformatic detection of resistance genes in whole-genome sequences in correctly predicting resistance phenotypes. METHODS Genomes of a collection of well-characterized commensal Escherichia coli were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq technology and assembled with SPAdes. Antibiotic resistance genes identified by PCR, SRST2 analysis of reads and ResFinder analysis of SPAdes assemblies were compared with known resistance phenotypes. RESULTS Generally, the antibiotic resistance genes detected using bioinformatic methods were concordant, but only ARG-ANNOT included sat2 However, the presence or absence of genes was not always predictive of the phenotype. In one strain, trimethoprim resistance was due to a known mutation in the chromosomal folA gene. In cases where the copy number was low, the aadA5 gene downstream of dfrA17 did not confer streptomycin or spectinomycin resistance. Resistance genes were found in the genomes that were not detected previously by PCRs targeting a limited gene set and gene cassettes in class 1 or class 2 integrons. In one isolate, the aadA1 gene cassette in the estX-aadA1 cassettes pair was outside an integron context and was not expressed. The qnrS1 gene, conferring reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, and the blaCMY-2 gene, encoding an ESBL, were each detected in a single isolate and mphA (macrolide resistance) was present in six isolates surrounded by IS26 and IS6100 CONCLUSIONS: WGS analysis detected more genes than PCR. Some were not expressed, causing inconsistencies with the experimentally determined phenotype. An unpredicted chromosomal folA mutation causing trimethoprim resistance was found.},

Several combinations of efflux pumps have been studied: (i) simultaneous expression of a single-component efflux pump, which exports antibiotics into the periplasm, in combination with a multicomponent efflux pump that accomplishes efflux directly into the external medium; (ii) simultaneous expression of two single-component pumps; and (iii) simultaneous expression of two multicomponent pumps. It was found that when efflux pumps of different structural types were combined in the same cell (the first case), the observed antibiotic resistance was much higher than that conferred by each of the pumps expressed singly. Simultaneous expression of pairs of single-component or multicomponent efflux pumps (the second and third cases) did not produce strong increases in antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {Prevalence and genetic relatedness were determined for third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli (3GC-R-Ec) detected in Swiss beef, veal, pork, and poultry retail meat. Samples from meat-packing plants (MPPs) processing 70{\%} of the slaughtered animals in Switzerland were purchased at different intervals between April and June 2013 and analyzed. Sixty-nine 3GC-R-Ec isolates were obtained and characterized by microarray, PCR/DNA sequencing, Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), and plasmid replicon typing. Plasmids of selected strains were transformed by electroporation into E. coli TOP10 cells and analyzed by plasmid MLST. The prevalence of 3GC-R-Ec was 73.3{\%} in chicken and 2{\%} in beef meat. No 3GC-R-Ec were found in pork and veal. Overall, the bla(CTX-M-1) (79.4{\%}), bla(CMY-2) (17.6{\%}), bla(CMY-4) (1.5{\%}), and bla(SHV-12) (1.5{\%}) beta-lactamase genes were detected, as well as other genes conferring resistance to chloramphenicol (cmlA1-like), sulfonamides (sul), tetracycline (tet), and trimethoprim (dfrA). The 3GC-R-Ec from chicken meat often harbored virulence genes associated with avian pathogens. Plasmid incompatibility (Inc) groups IncI1, IncFIB, IncFII, and IncB/O were the most frequent. A high rate of clonality (e.g., ST1304, ST38, and ST93) among isolates from the same MPPs suggests that strains persist at the plant and spread to meat at the carcass-processing stage. Additionally, the presence of the blaCTX-M-1 gene on an IncI1 plasmid sequence type 3 (IncI1/pST3) in genetically diverse strains indicates interstrain spread of an epidemic plasmid. The bla(CMY-2) and bla(CMY-4) genes were located on IncB/O plasmids. This study represents the first comprehensive assessment of 3GC-R-Ec in meat in Switzerland. It demonstrates the need for monitoring contaminants and for the adaptation of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point concept to avoid the spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria through the food chain.},

abstract = {Enterobacteriaceae resistant to quinolones frequently arise in animals, being easily disseminated through the food-chain. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants in Salmonella spp. ( n= 183) and Escherichia coli ( n= 180) isolates, collected from food-producing animals and food products among swine, poultry, rabbits and cattle. All isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular screening of PMQR determinants. ??-Lactamase-encoding genes, and the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes were also investigated in PMQR-positive isolates. Plasmid characterization was performed by conjugation, followed by replicon-typing. Genetic relatedness of PMQR-positive E. coli was examined by Multilocus Sequence Typing, while Salmonella was previously serotyped. The association of mobile genetic elements and PMQR was investigated through PCR mapping assays. Overall, 4.1{\%} (15/363) isolates harbored qnrB2 ( n= 3), qnrB19 ( n= 3), and qnrS1 ( n= 9) genes. All but one isolate presented one to four mutations in QRDR of gyrA or parC genes, which is consistent with the range of MIC values detected (0.19-64. mg/L) for ciprofloxacin; 60{\%} (9/15) of qnr-harboring isolates were non-susceptible to ??-lactam antibiotics which was justified by the presence of ??-lactamases from TEM (TEM-1, n= 8; TEM-135, n= 1) and SHV (SHV-108, n= 1) families. Analysis of mobile genetic elements revealed that qnr genes were detected nearby relevant genetic elements like intI1, ISEcl2, IS26 and ISCR1 and enclosed in diverse Inc. type plasmids. This study illustrated the existence of Qnr-producing E. coli and Salmonella from food-producing animals, associated to specific mobile elements that might mediate their transference between species and among distinct settings. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An investigation was made into the sensitivity of cells in the macaque superior temporal sulcus (STS) to the sight of different perspective views of the head. This allowed assessment of (a) whether coding was 'viewer-centred' (view specific) or 'object-centred' (view invariant) and (b) whether viewer-centred cells were preferentially tuned to 'characteristic' views of the head. The majority of cells (110) were found to be viewer-centred and exhibited unimodal tuning to one view. 5 cells displayed object-centred coding responding equally to all views of the head. A further 5 cells showed 'mixed' properties, responding to all views of the head but also discriminating between views. 6 out of 56 viewer and object-centred cells exhibited selectivity for face identity or species. Tuning to view varied in sharpness. For most (54/73) cells the angle of perspective rotation reducing response to half maximal was 45-70 degrees but for 19/73 it was greater than 90 degrees. More cells were optimally tuned to characteristic views of the head (the full face or profile) than to other views. Some cells were, however, found tuned to intermediate views throughout the full 360 degree range. This coding of many distinct head views may have a role in the analysis of social signals based on the interpretation of the direction of other individuals' attention.},

abstract = {Multilocus sequence typing reveals that many bacterial species have a clonal structure and that some clones are widespread. This underlying phylogeny was not revealed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, a method better suited to short-term outbreak investigation. Some global clones are multiresistant and it is easy to assume that these have disseminated from single foci. Such conclusions need caution, however, unless there is a clear epidemiological trail, as with KPC carbapenemase-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 from Greece to northwest Europe. Elsewhere, established clones may have repeatedly and independently acquired resistance. Thus, the global ST131 Escherichia coli clone most often has CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), but also occurs without ESBLs and as a host of many other ESBL types. We explore this interaction of clone and resistance for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii- a species where three global lineages dominate--and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which shows clonal diversity, but includes the relatively 'tight' serotype O12/Burst Group 4 cluster that has proved adept at acquiring resistances--from PSE-1 to VIM-1 beta-lactamases--for over 20 years. In summary, 'high-risk clones' play a major role in the spread of resistance, with the risk lying in their tenacity--deriving from poorly understood survival traits--and a flexible ability to accumulate and switch resistance, rather than to constant resistance batteries.},

abstract = {Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are among the most commonly used disinfectants. There has been concern that their widespread use will lead to the development of resistant organisms, and it has been suggested that limits should be place on their use. While increases in tolerance to QACs have been observed, there is no clear evidence to support the development of resistance to QACs. Since efflux pumps are believe to account for at least some of the increased tolerance found in bacteria, there has been concern that this will enhance the resistance of bacteria to certain antibiotics. QACs are membrane-active agents interacting with the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and lipids of viruses. The wide variety of chemical structures possible has seen an evolution in their effectiveness and expansion of applications over the last century, including non-lipid-containing viruses (i.e., noroviruses). Selection of formulations and methods of application have been shown to affect the efficacy of QACs. While numerous laboratory studies on the efficacy of QACs are available, relatively few studies have been conducted to assess their efficacy in practice. Better standardized tests for assessing and defining the differences between increases in tolerance versus resistance are needed. The ecological dynamics of microbial communities where QACs are a main line of defense against exposure to pathogens need to be better understood in terms of sublethal doses and antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {Two classification schemes for $\beta$-lactamases are currently in use. The molecular classification is based on the amino acid sequence and divides $\beta$-lactamases into class A, C, and D enzymes which utilize serine for $\beta$-lactam hydrolysis and class B metalloenzymes which require divalent zinc ions for substrate hydrolysis. The functional classification scheme updated herein is based on the 1995 proposal by Bush et al. (K. Bush, G. A. Jacoby, and A. A. Medeiros, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39:1211-1233, 1995). It takes into account substrate and inhibitor profiles in an attempt to group the enzymes in ways that can be correlated with their phenotype in clinical isolates. Major groupings generally correlate with the more broadly based molecular classification. The updated system includes group 1 (class C) cephalosporinases; group 2 (classes A and D) broad-spectrum, inhibitor-resistant, and extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamases and serine carbapenemases; and group 3 metallo-$\beta$-lactamases. Several new subgroups of each of the major groups are described, based on specific attributes of individual enzymes. A list of attributes is also suggested for the description of a new $\beta$-lactamase, including the requisite microbiological properties, substrate and inhibitor profiles, and molecular sequence data that provide an adequate characterization for a new $\beta$-lactam-hydrolyzing enzyme.},

A major goal of single-cell genomics is to complement gene-centric metagenomic data with whole-genome assemblies of uncultivated organisms. Assembly of single-cell data is challenging because of highly non-uniform read coverage as well as elevated levels of sequencing errors and chimeric reads. We describe SPAdes, a new assembler for both single-cell and standard (multicell) assembly, and demonstrate that it improves on the recently released E+V-SC assembler (specialized for single-cell data) and on popular assemblers Velvet and SoapDeNovo (for multicell data). SPAdes generates single-cell assemblies, providing information about genomes of uncultivatable bacteria that vastly exceeds what may be obtained via traditional metagenomics studies. SPAdes is available online ( http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades ). It is distributed as open source software.},

abstract = {One of the characteristic features of IncHI1 plasmids is a thermosensitive process of conjugation, which is optimal between 22 degrees C and 30 degrees C but inhibited at 37 degrees C. R27, the prototypical IncHI1 plasmid, contains transfer genes clustered in two regions of the plasmid, Tra1 and Tra2. In the present study, transcriptional analyses of the tra genes were undertaken at both 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Screening of 38 tra genes showed that tra genes are transcriptionally linked in six operons, three in each Tra region. RT-PCR analysis showed that gene expression was reduced at 37 degrees C relative to that observed at 30 degrees C. The transcription start sites of the six transcripts were identified, promoters and upstream regions were cloned, and transcription was tested at both temperatures. In cells grown at 37 degrees C, in the presence of R27, the promoters were inhibited, except for promoters of the H operon and AN operon. Conditions that influenced DNA topology, such as osmolarity, anaerobiosis, quorum sensing and acidity, showed no significant influence on transfer frequency. These results should facilitate future understanding of the basis of temperature-sensitive transfer in this large conjugative plasmid.},

abstract = {Quinolones are widely used, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. In screens for genes that, when overexpressed, allow Escherichia coli to grow on otherwise lethal concentrations of the fluoroquinolone norfloxacin, the ydhE gene was identified. We have shown that ydhE encodes a multidrug efflux pump with a narrower substrate range than that of its closest homologue, encoded by norM, and named the gene norE. The relative contributions to drug resistance of NorE compared with the two other known E. coli quinolone pumps, AcrAB and MdfA, have been defined. Overexpression of each of the three pumps separately resulted in roughly similar levels of quinolone resistance, whereas simultaneous overexpression of norE or mdfA in combination with acrAB gave synergic increases in quinolone resistance. The level of quinolone resistance mediated by efflux pumps seems to be constrained to an approximately 10-fold maximum, even with increased production of the pumps. We measured the drug resistance of an isogenic set of strains containing the various permutations of single, double and triple drug efflux pump mutants. The DeltanorE and DeltamdfA mutants were somewhat more susceptible to fluoroquinolones than the parent strain, and acrAB mutants were four- to six-fold more susceptible. Mutants lacking two or all three efflux pumps were not significantly more susceptible to fluoroquinolones than those lacking only one of the three pumps.},

abstract = {This paper on the fluoroquinolone resistance epidemiology stratifies the data according to the different prescription patterns by either primary or tertiary caregivers and by indication. Global surveillance studies demonstrate that fluoroquinolone resistance rates increased in the past years in almost all bacterial species except S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae , causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections. However, 10 to 30{\%} of these isolates harbored first-step mutations conferring low level fluoroquinolone resistance. Fluoroquinolone resistance increased in Enterobacteriaceae causing community acquired or healthcare associated urinary tract infections and intraabdominal infections, exceeding 50{\%} in some parts of the world, particularly in Asia. One to two-thirds of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum -lactamases were fluoroquinolone resistant too. Furthermore, fluoroquinolones select for methicillin resistance in Staphylococci . Neisseria gonorrhoeae acquired fluoroquinolone resistance rapidly; actual resistance rates are highly variable and can be as high as almost 100{\%}, particularly in Asia, whereas resistance rates in Europe and North America range from {\textless}10{\%} in rural areas to {\textgreater}30{\%} in established sexual networks. In general, the continued increase in fluoroquinolone resistance affects patient management and necessitates changes in some guidelines, for example, treatment of urinary tract, intra-abdominal, skin and skin structure infections, and traveller's diarrhea, or even precludes the use in indications like sexually transmitted diseases and enteric fever.},

abstract = {Cultured cells possess high-affinity binding sites (receptors) for high density lipoprotein (HDL) that appear to mediate removal of excess intracellular cholesterol from cells. To examine the role of intact HDL apoproteins in receptor-mediated cholesterol removal, HDL3 apoproteins were digested with the proteolytic enzymes trypsin and pronase, and the residual particles were used in sterol efflux experiments. Protease treatment abolished the interaction of HDL3 with the 110-kd cell membrane protein postulated to represent the HDL receptor molecule, indicating that this interaction is mediated by HDL apoproteins rather than lipids. Compared with native HDL3 protease-modified HDL3 had a markedly reduced ability to selectively remove sterol from intracellular pools, even though modified particles promoted greater cholesterol efflux from the plasma membrane than did native particles. These results indicate that whereas sterol efflux from plasma membranes is mediated by HDL lipids, removal of excess intracellular sterol from cells is mediated by HDL apoproteins. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that receptor binding of HDL apoproteins stimulates translocation of excess intracellular sterol to the cell surface where it becomes accessible for removal by HDL or other lipid-rich acceptor particles.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Fresh faeces from a healthy volunteer, negative for cephalosporin-resistant E. coli, were selected to prepare inocula. The microbiota was monitored by plating on diverse selective media, and a shift in the populations of bacteria was examined by 16S rDNA PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Escherichia coli transconjugants were verified by plasmid and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles (PFGE). The avian extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive E. coli was able to proliferate without selective pressure of cefotaxime, and E. coli transconjugants of human origin were detected 24 h after inoculation of the donor strain. Upon administration of cefotaxime to the fresh medium, an increase in the population size of E. coli B1-54 and the transconjugants was observed. PFGE and plasmid analysis revealed a limited number of human E. coli clones receptive for the bla(TEM-52) -carrying plasmid. CONCLUSIONS: These observations provide evidence of the maintenance of an E. coli strain of poultry origin and the horizontal gene transfer in the human commensal bowel microbiota even without antimicrobial treatment. Significance and IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The fact that an E. coli strain of poultry origin might establish itself and transfer its bla gene to commensal human E. coli raises public health concerns.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In view of the intercontinental emergence of Escherichia coli clone O25:H4-ST131 producing CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in human clinical settings it would be of great interest to explore its existence in animals to unravel a possible reservoir function and the origin and transmission of this group of multiresistant strains. METHODS: A total of 177 clinical phenotypically ESBL-producing E. coli isolates, mainly obtained from companion animals with urinary tract infections, wound infections and diarrhoea, were collected in a veterinary diagnostic laboratory covering a European-wide service area. They were screened for molecular subtype O25b and multilocus sequence type 131. O25b-ST131 isolates were subsequently tested for ESBL types, and phenotypic and genotypic resistance determinants. Further characterization of the strains was performed by PFGE and virulence gene typing. RESULTS: Ten (5.6{\%}) of 177 phenotypically ESBL-producing E. coli isolates, nine strains from dogs and one strain from a horse, were allocated to the B2-O25b-ST131 lineage. Nine of these isolates harboured a CTX-M-15-type beta-lactamase enzyme while one strain possessed an SHV-12-type ESBL. Macrorestriction analysis revealed a cluster formation of six of the animal CTX-M-15-type ESBL-producing strains from five different European countries together with a human control strain constituting a group of clonally related strains at a similarity value of 87.0{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the group of clonally related human B2-O25:H4-ST131 CTX-M-15-type ESBL-producing E. coli strains is present in companion animals from various European countries. This highlights the possibility of inter-species transmission of these multiresistant strains from human to animal and vice versa.},

abstract = {A combination of phenotypic and genotypic methods was used to investigate 70 unique Escherichia coli clinical isolates identified as producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) at a medical center in Pittsburgh, PA, between 2007 and 2008. Fifty-seven isolates (81{\%}) produced CTX-M-type ESBLs, among which CTX-M-15 was predominant (n = 46). Isolates producing CTX-M-2, -9, -14, and -65 were also identified. One CTX-M-producing isolate coproduced CMY-2 cephalosporinase. Ten isolates (14{\%}) produced SHV-type ESBLs, either SHV-5 or SHV-7. Two isolates produced only CMY-2 or -32. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of two major clusters of CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates, one in phylotype B2 (n = 15) and the other in phylotype A (n = 19). Of four phylotype B2 isolates that were able to transfer the bla(CTX-M-15)-carrying plasmids, three showed fingerprints related ({\textgreater}60{\%}) to those of plasmids from phylotype A isolates. In phylotype B2, all CTX-M-15-producing isolates, as well as three isolates producing CTX-M-14, two producing SHV-5, and one producing SHV-7, belonged to the international epidemic clone defined by serotype O25:H4 and sequence type 131. The plasmids from eight of nine CTX-M-15-producing E. coli isolates of phylotype A that were examined were highly related to each other and were also found in two isolates belonging to phylotype D, suggesting horizontal transfer of this bla(CTX-M-15)-carrying plasmid between phylotypes. Our findings underscore the need to further investigate the epidemiology and virulence of CTX-M-producing E. coli in the United States.},

abstract = {The influence of biotic and abiotic factors on plasmid transfer between Escherichia coli strains in terms of the variation in the number of transconjugants formed and the variation in transfer frequency was investigated. The density of parent cells affected the number of transconjugants, reaching a maximum when the cell density was on the order of 10(8) CFU ml-1. As the donor-to-recipient ratios varied from 10(-4) to 10(4), the number of transconjugants varied significantly (P less than 0.001), reaching a maximum with donor-to-recipient ratios between 1 and 10. The concentration of total organic carbon in the mating medium affects both the number of transconjugants and the transfer frequency, being significantly higher (P less than 0.001) when the total organic carbon concentration was higher than 1,139 mg of C liter-1. However, the transconjugants were detected even with less than 1 mg of C liter-1. Linear regression of log10 transconjugants versus mating temperature showed a highly significant regression line (P less than 0.001). Neither the transfer frequency nor the transconjugant number varied significantly in the range of pHs assayed. We can conclude that plasmid transfer by conjugation can take place within a wide range of conditions, even in such adverse conditions as the absence of nutrients and low temperatures.},

abstract = {The AcrAB-TolC system in Escherichia coli is an intrinsic RND-type multidrug efflux transporter that functions as a tripartite complex of the inner membrane transporter AcrB, the outer membrane channel TolC and the adaptor protein AcrA. Although the crystal structures of each component of this system have been elucidated, a crystal structure of the whole complex has not been solved. The available crystal structures have shown that AcrB and TolC function as trimers, but the number of AcrA molecules in the complex is now under debate. Disulfide chemical cross-linking experiments have indicated that the stoichiometry of AcrB:AcrA:TolC is 1:1:1; on the other hand, recent cryo-electron microscopy images of AcrAB-TolC have suggested a 1:2:1 stoichiometry. In this study, we constructed 1:1-fixed AcrB-AcrA fusion proteins using various linkers. Surprisingly, all the 1:1-fixed linker proteins showed drug export activity under both acrAB -deficient conditions and acrABacrEF double-pump knockout conditions regardless of the lengths of the linkers. Finally, we optimized a shorter linker lacking the conformational freedom imparted by the AcrB C-terminus. These results suggest that a complex with equal amounts of AcrA and AcrB is sufficient for drug export function.},

abstract = {Background: Because of high rates of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance in Escherichia coli, Denver Health switched to levofloxacin as the initial therapy for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 1999. We evaluated the effects of that switch 6 years later. Methods: Levofloxacin prescriptions per 1000 outpatient visits and levofloxacin resistance in outpatient E. coli were evaluated over time. E. coli isolated in 2005 were further characterized by specimen source and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Risk factors for levofloxacin-resistant E. coli UTI among nonpregnant adult outpatients were evaluated in a case-control study. Results: Between 1998 and 2005, levofloxacin use increased from 3.1 to 12.7 prescriptions per 1000 visits (P {\textless} .01) and resistance in outpatients increased from 1{\%} to 9{\%} (P {\textless} .01). Although prescriptions for sulfonamide antibiotics decreased by half during the same period, E. coli resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole increased from 26.1{\%} to 29.6{\%}. Levofloxacin-resistant E. coli were more likely resistant to other antibiotics than levofloxacin-susceptible isolates (90{\%} vs 43{\%}, P {\textless} .0001). Risk factors for levofloxacin-resistant E. coli UTI were hospitalization (odds ratio for each week of hospitalization, 2.0; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.0-3.9) and use of levofloxacin (odds ratio, 5.6; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.1-27.5) within the previous year. Conclusion: Fluoroquinolone prescriptions increased markedly after an institutional policy change for empiric treatment of UTI, and a rapid increase in fluoroquinolone resistance among outpatient E. coli followed. Risk factors for infection with resistant E. coli were recent hospitalization and levofloxacin use. Risk factors should be considered before initiating empiric treatment with a fluoroquinolone. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Living organisms are defined by the genes they possess. Control of expression of this gene set, both temporally and in response to the environment, determines whether an organism can survive changing conditions and can compete for the resources it needs to reproduce. Bacteria are no exception; changes to the genome will, in general, threaten the ability of the microbe to survive, but acquisition of new genes may enhance its chances of survival by allowing growth in a previously hostile environment. For example, acquisition of an antibiotic resistance gene by a bacterial pathogen can permit it to thrive in the presence of an antibiotic that would otherwise kill it; this may compromise clinical treatments. Many forces, chemical and genetic, can alter the genetic content of DNA by locally changing its nucleotide sequence. Notable for genetic change in bacteria are transposable elements and site-specific recombination systems such as integrons. Many of the former can mobilize genes from one replicon to another, including chromosome-plasmid translocation, thus establishing conditions for interspecies gene transfer. Balancing this, transposition activity can result in loss or rearrangement of DNA sequences. This chapter discusses bacterial DNA transfer systems, transposable elements and integrons, and the contributions each makes towards the evolution of bacterial genomes, particularly in relation to bacterial pathogenesis. It highlights the variety of phylogenetically distinct transposable elements, the variety of transposition mechanisms, and some of the implications of rearranging DNA, and addresses the effects of genetic change on the fitness of the microbe.},

abstract = {A total of 295 ceftiofur-resistant Escherichia coli isolates were obtained from 489 cloacal samples collected at five different Belgian broiler farms with the aim to evaluate the diversity of this resistance at the farm level. Strains were examined for resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents by using disk diffusion tests. Three different beta-lactam resistance phenotypes suggested the presence of an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), a class C beta-lactamase, or the combination of an ESBL with a class C beta-lactamase. Seventy-six percent of these isolates also showed acquired resistance to other antimicrobial agents. After genotyping by repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR, 51 unrelated E. coli strains were selected for further analyses. Isoelectric focusing and sequencing of the amplicons obtained in PCRs for the detection of genes encoding broad-spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes revealed the following ESBLs: TEM-52 (13.2{\%}), TEM-106 (2{\%}), CTX-M-1 (27.4{\%}), CTX-M-2 (7.8{\%}), CTX-M-14 (5.9{\%}), and CTX-M-15 (2{\%}). The only plasmidic AmpC beta-lactamase found in this study was the CMY-2 enzyme (49{\%}). Mutations in the promoter and attenuator regions of the chromosomal ampC gene were found only in association with bla CMY-2 genes and ESBL genes. The combination of an ESBL (CTX-M-1) with a plasmidic AmpC beta-lactamase (CMY-2) was found in 7.8{\%} of the isolates. These data show that ceftiofur-resistant E. coli strains are often present in cloacal samples of broilers at the farm level in Belgium. The diversity of broad-spectrum beta-lactamases among these isolates is high, and they may act as a reservoir of ESBL and ampC genes.},

abstract = {The epidemiology of an enrofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli clone was investigated during two separate outbreaks of colibacillosis in the Danish broiler production. In total five flocks were reported affected by the outbreaks. Recorded first-week mortalities were in the range of 1.7-12.7{\%}. The clone was first isolated from dead broilers and subsequently demonstrated in samples from associated hatchers and the parent flock with its embryonated eggs, suggesting a vertical transmission from the parents. The second outbreak involved two broiler flocks unrelated to the affected flocks from the first outbreak. However, the clone could not be demonstrated in the associated parent flock. Furthermore, samplings from grand-parent flocks were negative for the outbreak clone. The clonality was evaluated by plasmid profiling and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. None of the recognized virulence factors were demonstrated in the outbreak clone by microarray and PCR assay. The molecular background for the fluoroquinolone-resistance was investigated and point mutations in gyrA and parC leading to amino-acid substitutions in quinolone-resistance determining regions of GyrA and ParC were demonstrated. Vertical transmission of enrofloxacin-resistant E. coli from healthy parents resulting in high first-week mortality in the offspring illustrates the potential of the emergence and spreading of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria in animal husbandry, even though the use of fluoroquinolones is restricted. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

ESBL-producing E. coli were detected at all investigated laying hen farms (n = 5) and broiler farms (n = 3) in 65{\%} (46/71) and 81{\%} (57/70) of poultry faeces samples, respectively. They were detected in rinse water and run-off water (21/26; 81{\%}), other farm animals (11/14; 79{\%}), dust (21/35; 60{\%}), surface water adjacent to farms (20/35; 57{\%}), soil (48/87; 55{\%}), on flies (11/73; 15{\%}), and in barn air (2/33; 6{\%}). The highest prevalence and concentrations in the outdoor environment were observed in soil of free-range areas at laying hen farms (100{\%} of samples positive, geometric mean concentration 2.4x10(4) cfu/kg), and surface waters adjacent to broiler farms during, or shortly after, cleaning between production rounds (91{\%} of samples positive, geometric mean concentration 1.9x10(2) cfu/l). The diversity of ESBL-producing E. coli variants with respect to sequence type, phylogenetic group, ESBL-genotype and antibiotic resistance profile was high, especially on broiler farms where on average 16 different variants were detected, and the average Simpson's Indices of diversity (SID; 1-D) were 0.93 and 0.94 among flock and environmental isolates respectively. At laying hen farms on average nine variants were detected, with SIDs of 0.63 (flock isolates) and 0.77 (environmental isolates). Sixty percent of environmental isolates were identical to flock isolates at the same farm. The highest proportions of 'flock variants' were observed in dust (94{\%}), run-off gullies (82{\%}), and barn air (67{\%}), followed by surface water (57{\%}), soil (56{\%}), flies (50{\%}) and other farm animals (35{\%}).The introduction of ESBL-producing E. coli from poultry farms to the environment may pose a health risk if these bacteria reach places where people may become exposed.},

abstract = {Mutation is fundamental to evolution, because it generates the genetic variation on which selection can act. In nature, genetic changes often increase the mutation rate in systems that range from viruses and bacteria to human tumors. Such an increase promotes the accumulation of frequent deleterious or neutral alleles, but it can also increase the chances that a population acquires rare beneficial alleles. Here, we study how up to 100-fold increases in Escherichia coli's genomic mutation rate affect adaptive evolution. To do so, we evolved multiple replicate populations of asexual E. coli strains engineered to have four different mutation rates for 3000 generations in the laboratory. We measured the ability of evolved populations to grow in their original environment and in more than 90 novel chemical environments. In addition, we subjected the populations to whole genome population sequencing. Although populations with higher mutation rates accumulated greater genetic diversity, this diversity conveyed benefits only for modestly increased mutation rates, where populations adapted faster and also thrived better than their ancestors in some novel environments. In contrast, some populations at the highest mutation rates showed reduced adaptation during evolution, and failed to thrive in all of the 90 alternative environments. In addition, they experienced a dramatic decrease in mutation rate. Our work demonstrates that the mutation rate changes the global balance between deleterious and beneficial mutational effects on fitness. In contrast to most theoretical models, our experiments suggest that this tipping point already occurs at the modest mutation rates that are found in the wild.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli represents an incredible versatile and diverse enterobacterial species and can be subdivided into the following; (i) intestinal non-pathogenic, commensal isolates. (ii) Intestinal pathogenic isolates and (iii) extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli or ExPEC isolates. The presence to several putative virulence genes has been positively linked with the pathogenicity of ExPEC. E. coli remains one of the most frequent causes of nosocomial and community-acquired bacterial infections including urinary tract infections, enteric infections, and systemic infections in humans. ExPEC has emerged in 2000s as an important player in the resistance to antibiotics including the cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Most importantly among ExPEC is the increasing recognition of isolates producing "newer beta-lactamases" that consists of plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases (e.g., CMY), extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (e.g., CTX-M), and carbapenemases (e.g., NDM). This review will highlight aspects of virulence associated with ExPEC, provide a brief overview of plasmid-mediated resistance to beta-lactams including the characteristics of the successful international sequence types such as ST38, ST131, ST405, and ST648 among ExPEC.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to determine whether strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium which had acquired low-level multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) through repeated exposure to farm disinfectants were able to colonize and transmit between chicks as easily as the parent strain and, if such strains were less susceptible to fluoroquinolones, would high-level resistance be selected after fluoroquinolone treatment. METHODS: Two mutants were compared with the isogenic parent. In the first experiment, day-old chicks were co-infected with both the parent and a mutant to determine their relative fitness. In the second experiment, parent and mutant strains (in separate groups of chicks) were assessed for their ability to transmit from infected (contact) to non-infected (naive) birds and with respect to their susceptibility to fluoroquinolone treatment. Birds were regularly monitored for the presence of Salmonella in caecal contents. Replica plating was used to monitor for the selection of antibiotic-resistant strains. RESULTS: The parent strain was shown to be significantly fitter than the two mutants and was more rapidly disseminated to naive birds. Antibiotic treatment did not preferentially select for the two mutants or for resistant strains. CONCLUSIONS: The disinfectant-exposed strains, although MAR, were less fit, less able to disseminate than the parent strain and were not preferentially selected by therapeutic antibiotic treatment. As such, these strains are unlikely to present a greater problem than other salmonellae in chickens.},

To date, little attention has been paid to potential implications of QAC use in the emergence of antibiotic resistance, especially fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria in patients and in the environment. QAC-induced overexpression of efflux pumps can lead to: cross resistance with fluoroquinolones mediated by multidrug efflux pumps; stress response facilitating mutation in the Quinolone Resistance Determining Region; and biofilm formation increasing the risk of transfer of mobile genetic elements carrying fluoroquinolone or QAC resistance determinants. By following the European Biocidal Product Regulation, manufacturers of QAC are required to ensure that their QAC-based biocidal products are safe and will not contribute to emerging bacterial resistance.},

abstract = {ESBL/AmpC-producing Escherichia coli is increasingly isolated from humans and animals worldwide. The occurrence of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli was studied in food-producing animals in Finland, a country with a low and controlled use of antimicrobials in meat production chain. A total of 648 cattle, 531 pig, 495 broiler and 35 turkey faecal samples were collected from four Finnish slaughterhouses to determine the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL/AmpC)-producing E. coli. In addition, 260 broiler and 15 turkey samples were screened for carbapenemase-producing E. coli. Susceptibility to different class of cephalosporins and meropenem was determined with disc diffusion tests according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). Determination of ESBL/AmpC production was performed with a combination disc diffusion test according to the recommendations of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Plasmidic blaESBL/AmpC genes were characterized by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. A collection of isolates producing AmpC enzyme but not carrying plasmidic blaAmpC was analysed by PCR and sequencing for possible chromosomal ampC promoter area mutations. Altogether ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli was recovered from five cattle (0.8{\%}), eight pig (1.5{\%}) and 40 broiler samples (8.1{\%}). No ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli was found in turkey samples. Carbapenem resistance was not detected. Altogether ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli was found on 4 (2.0{\%}), 3 (4.5{\%}) and 14 (25{\%}) cattle, pig and broiler farms, respectively. From cattle samples 3 (27{\%}) blaCTX-M-1 and from broiler samples 13 (33{\%}) blaCTX-M-1 and 22 (55{\%}) blaCMY-2 gene-carrying isolates were detected. In pigs, no plasmidic blaESBL/AmpC gene-carrying isolates were found. In all analysed isolates, the same mutations in the promoter region of chromosomal ampC were detected. The results showed low occurrence of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in Finnish food-producing animals. In pigs, plasmidic blaESBL/AmpC -carrying E. coli was not detected at all.},

abstract = {Fast and accurate identification and typing of pathogens are essential for effective surveillance and outbreak detection. The current routine procedure is based on a variety of techniques, making the procedure laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. With whole-genome sequencing (WGS) becoming cheaper, it has huge potential in both diagnostics and routine surveillance. The aim of this study was to perform a real-time evaluation of WGS for routine typing and surveillance of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC). In Denmark, the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) routinely receives all suspected VTEC isolates. During a 7-week period in the fall of 2012, all incoming isolates were concurrently subjected to WGS using IonTorrent PGM. Real-time bioinformatics analysis was performed using web-tools (www.genomicepidemiology.org) for species determination, multilocus sequence type (MLST) typing, and determination of phylogenetic relationship, and a specific VirulenceFinder for detection of E. coli virulence genes was developed as part of this study. In total, 46 suspected VTEC isolates were characterized in parallel during the study. VirulenceFinder proved successful in detecting virulence genes included in routine typing, explicitly verocytotoxin 1 (vtx1), verocytotoxin 2 (vtx2), and intimin (eae), and also detected additional virulence genes. VirulenceFinder is also a robust method for assigning verocytotoxin (vtx) subtypes. A real-time clustering of isolates in agreement with the epidemiology was established from WGS, enabling discrimination between sporadic and outbreak isolates. Overall, WGS typing produced results faster and at a lower cost than the current routine. Therefore, WGS typing is a superior alternative to conventional typing strategies. This approach may also be applied to typing and surveillance of other pathogens.},

abstract = {The aim of this article was to define the sampling level and method combination that captures antibiotic resistance at pig herd level utilizing qPCR antibiotic resistance gene quantification and culture-based quantification of antibiotic resistant coliform indicator bacteria. Fourteen qPCR assays for commonly detected antibiotic resistance genes were developed, and used to quantify antibiotic resistance genes in total DNA from swine fecal samples that were obtained using different sampling and pooling methods. In parallel, the number of antibiotic resistant coliform indicator bacteria was determined in the same swine fecal samples. The results showed that the qPCR assays were capable of detecting differences in antibiotic resistance levels in individual animals that the coliform bacteria colony forming units (CFU) could not. Also, the qPCR assays more accurately quantified antibiotic resistance genes when comparing individual sampling and pooling methods. qPCR on pooled samples was found to be a good representative for the general resistance level in a pig herd compared to the coliform CFU counts. It had significantly reduced relative standard deviations compared to coliform CFU counts in the same samples, and therefore differences in antibiotic resistance levels between samples were more readily detected. To our knowledge, this is the first study to describe sampling and pooling methods for qPCR quantification of antibiotic resistance genes in total DNA extracted from swine feces.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli strains from patients with uncomplicated urinary tract infections were examined by DNA sequencing for fluoroquinolone resistance-associated mutations in six genes: gyrA, gyrB, parC, parE, marOR, and acrR. The 54 strains analyzed had a susceptibility range distributed across 15 dilutions of the fluoroquinolone MICs. There was a correlation between the fluoroquinolone MIC and the number of resistance mutations that a strain carried, with resistant strains having mutations in two to five of these genes. Most resistant strains carried two mutations in gyrA and one mutation in parC. In addition, many resistant strains had mutations in parE, marOR, and/or acrR. No (resistance) mutation was found in gyrB. Thus, the evolution of fluoroquinolone resistance involves the accumulation of multiple mutations in several genes. The spontaneous mutation rate in these clinical strains varied by 2 orders of magnitude. A high mutation rate correlated strongly with a clinical resistance phenotype. This correlation suggests that an increased general mutation rate may play a significant role in the development of high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones by increasing the rate of accumulation of rare new mutations.},

abstract = {Isogenic mutants derived from quinolone-susceptible isolate WT by introducing gyrA (S83L, D87G) and parC (S80I, E84K) mutations associated with quinolone resistance were characterized with respect to quinolone resistance, growth rate, and degree of global supercoiling. The latter was determined by use of a pair of reporter plasmids carrying supercoiling-dependent promoters pgyrA and ptopA, respectively, transcriptionally fused to the reporter gene bla coding for TEM-1 beta-lactamase. The quotient (Qsc) of the beta-lactamase specific activity determined for a mutant carrying either plasmid was taken as a measure of the degree of global supercoiling. These Qsc data were comparable to results obtained from the separation of topoisomers of plasmid pBR322 on chloroquine-containing agarose gels and indicate a reduced degree of negative supercoiling in resistant mutants relative to the parent, WT. The S83L mutation in gyrA had the strongest influence on quinolone resistance while leaving other parameters nearly unaffected. The gyrA double mutation (S83L plus D87G) had an effect on quinolone resistance similar to that of a single mutation. Phenotypic expression of the parC mutation (S80I) was dependent on the presence of at least one gyrA mutation. Expression of high-level fluoroquinolone resistance (ciprofloxacin MIC, {\textgreater} 4 micrograms/ml) required a combination of the gyrA double mutation and one parC mutation (S80I or E84K). Such mutants showed considerable alterations of growth rate, global supercoiling, or both. Introduction of a parC mutation affected neither the doubling time nor the degree of supercoiling, while the presence of the gyrA D87G mutation was associated with a significant reduction in the degree of DNA supercoiling.},

abstract = {Nucleotide sequences of the gapA gene, encoding the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, were determined for 16 strains of Salmonella and 13 strains of Escherichia coli recovered from natural populations. Pairs of sequences from strains representing the eight serovar groups of Salmonella differed, on average, at 3.8{\%} of nucleotide sites and 1.1{\%} of inferred amino acids, and comparable values for E. coli were an order of magnitude smaller (0.2{\%} and 0.1{\%}, respectively). The rate of substitution at synonymous sites was significantly higher for codons specifying the catalytic domain of the enzyme than for those encoding the NAD(+)-binding domain, but the nonsynonymous substitution rate showed the opposite relationship. For Salmonella, statistical tests for nonrandom clustering of polymorphic sites failed to provide evidence that intragenic recombination or gene conversion has contributed to the generation of allelic diversity. The topology of a tree constructed from the gapA sequences was generally similar to that of phylogenetic trees of the strains based on multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, but the level of divergence of gapA in Salmonella group V from other Salmonella and E. coli strains is much greater than that indicated by DNA hybridization for the genome as a whole.},

abstract = {Although plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) was thought not to exist before its discovery in 1998, the past decade has seen an explosion of research characterizing this phenomenon. The best-described form of PMQR is determined by the qnr group of genes. These genes, likely originating in aquatic organisms, code for pentapeptide repeat proteins. These proteins reduce susceptibility to quinolones by protecting the complex of DNA and DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV enzymes from the inhibitory effect of quinolones. Two additional PMQR mechanisms were recently described. aac(6')-Ib-cr encodes a variant aminoglycoside acetyltransferase with two amino acid alterations allowing it to inactivate ciprofloxacin through the acetylation of its piperazinyl substituent. oqxAB and qepA encode efflux pumps that extrude quinolones. All of these genes determine relatively small increases in the MICs of quinolones, but these changes are sufficient to facilitate the selection of mutants with higher levels of resistance. The contribution of these genes to the emergence of quinolone resistance is being actively investigated. Several factors suggest their importance in this process, including their increasing ubiquity, their association with other resistance elements, and their emergence simultaneous with the expansion of clinical quinolone resistance. Of concern, these genes are not yet being taken into account in resistance screening by clinical microbiology laboratories.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli (E. coli) exhibits considerable physiological and metabolic versatility and includes a variety of non-pathogenic, commensal variants, which belong to the normal gut flora of humans and warm-blooded animals. Additionally, several pathogenic variants have been identified which cause various types of intestinal or extraintestinal infections in humans and animals. In contrast to intestinal pathogenic E. coli (IPEC), which are obligate pathogens, extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) are facultative pathogens which belong to the normal gut flora of a certain fraction of the healthy population where they live as commensals. Comparative genomics and epidemiological studies have been applied to study genomic diversity, markers, and phenotypic traits that may support discrimination of different E. coli pathotypes. Whereas IPEC are often epidemiologically and phylogenetically distinct from ExPEC and non-pathogenic, commensal strains, many ExPEC and non-pathogenic E. coli share large genomic fractions. Furthermore, extraintestinal infections of elderly or immunocompromised patients can be caused by E. coli variants which differ in their geno- and phenotypes from archetypal ExPEC. Thus, strain typing based on the detection of a limited number of ExPEC virulence/fitness-related genes may be ambiguous. A limited number of ExPEC-dominated clonal complexes can be identified in the E. coli population by multi locus sequence typing. Nevertheless, ExPEC and non-pathogenic E. coli cannot be clearly discriminated by molecular epidemiological approaches. Increased knowledge of the phylogeny, virulence and fitness traits, and host factors contributing to host susceptibility of the different groups of ExPEC variants is required for a better understanding of the biological basis of ExPEC infections. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Chicken products represent a source for multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli causing extraintestinal infections (ExPEC) in humans. We applied phylogenetic analysis to a collection of E. coli strains from both hosts (poultry/humans) to improve our understanding of the origin and spread of ExPEC in humans. The dataset consisted of 58 sequences among 172 E. coli strains from human extraintestinal infections and avian species. Human phylogenetic tree analysis showed a major clade, within which ST clones belonging to groups A and B1 were largely intermixed, and two clusters, each exclusively including B2 or D clones. The avian tree exhibited greater heterogeneity between and within clades/clusters. In the Bayesian tree, consisting of sequences from both human and avian E. coli, the B2 and D human ST clones were clustered together separate from the avian strains, whereas B1 and A ST clones (frequently associated with multidrug resistance) were intermixed with avian strains. This study suggests that a subgroup of E. coli clones, A and B1, associated with multidrug resistance, is potentially exchangeable between poultry and humans. Such a subgroup may be of public health concern. On the contrary, E. coli clones included in B2 and D appeared clearly separate between human and avian sources, suggesting a minor zoonotic potential of these phylotypes.},

abstract = {Contrary to what was thought previously, bacteria seem to be, not merely spectators to their own evolution, but, through a variety of mechanisms, able to increase the rate at which mutations occur and, consequently, to increase their chances of becoming resistant to antibiotics. Laboratory studies and mathematical models suggest that, under stressful conditions, such as antibiotic challenge, selective pressure favors mutator strains of bacteria over nonmutator strains. These hypermutable strains have been found in natural bacterial populations at higher frequencies than expected. The presence of mutator strains in the clinical setting may indicate an enhanced risk of acquiring antibiotic resistance through mutational and recombinational events. In addition, some antibiotics are inducers of mechanisms that transiently increase the mutation rate, and thus probably act, not only as mere selectors of antibiotic resistant clones, but also as resistance-promoters.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins have been detected in the Norwegian broiler production, despite the fact that antimicrobial agents are rarely used. The genetic mechanism responsible for cephalosporin resistance is mainly attributed to the presence of the blaCMY-2 gene encoding a plasmid-mediated AmpC-beta-lactamase (pAmpC). The aim of this study was to characterize and compare blaCMY-2 containing Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal flora of broilers and retail chicken meat (fillets) to identify possible successful clones and/or resistance plasmids widespread in the Norwegian broiler production. Methods used included PCR based phylotyping, conjugation experiments, plasmid replicon typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multiple locus variable-number tandem-repeats analysis and whole genome sequencing. The nucleotide sequence of an IncK plasmid carrying blaCMY-2 was determined. Intestinal isolates displayed a higher degree of genetic diversity than meat isolates. A cluster of genetically related isolates belonging to ST38, phylogroup D, carrying blaCMY-2 containing IncK plasmids was identified. Furthermore, genes encoding plasmid stability systems (relBE/stbDE and pndAC) were identified on the IncK plasmid. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of a subset of isolates confirmed a close genetic relationship within the two most prevalent STs. The IncK plasmids within these two STs also shared a high degree of similarity. Cephalosporin-resistant E. coli with the same genetic characteristics have been identified in the broiler production in other European countries, and the IncK plasmid characterized in this study showed close homology to a plasmid isolated from retail chicken meat in the Netherlands. The results indicate that both clonal expansion and horizontal transfer of blaCMY-2 containing plasmids contribute to dissemination of cephalosporin resistant E. coli in the broiler production. The presence of plasmid stability systems may explain why the IncK plasmid containing blaCMY-2 is maintained and disseminated in the Norwegian broiler production in absence of selection pressure from the use of antimicrobial agents.},

OBJECTIVES To assess national rates of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative aerobic isolates recovered from ICU patients and to compare these rates to antimicrobial use. DESIGN AND SETTING Participating institutions, representing a total of 43 US states plus the District of Columbia, provided antibiotic susceptibility results for 35 790 nonduplicate gram-negative aerobic isolates recovered from ICU patients between 1994 and 2000. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Each institution tested approximately 100 consecutive gram-negative aerobic isolates recovered from ICU patients. Organisms were identified to the species level. Susceptibility tests were performed, and national fluoroquinolone consumption data were obtained. RESULTS The activity of most antimicrobial agents against gram-negative aerobic isolates showed an absolute decrease of 6{\%} or less over the study period. The overall susceptibility to ciprofloxacin decreased steadily from 86{\%} in 1994 to 76{\%} in 2000 and was significantly associated with increased national use of fluoroquinolones. CONCLUSIONS This study documents the increasing incidence of ciprofloxacin resistance among gram-negative bacilli that has occurred coincident with increased use of fluoroquinolones. More judicious use of fluoroquinolones will be necessary to limit this downward trend.},

These genes have been frequently identified in Escherichia coli and Salmonella from food animals, the most common being blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-14, and blaCMY-2. Identification of risk factors for their occurrence in food animals is complex. In addition to generic antimicrobial use, cephalosporin usage is an important risk factor for selection and spread of these genes. Extensive international trade of animals is a further risk factor. There are no data on the effectiveness of individual control options in reducing public health risks. A highly effective option would be to stop or restrict cephalosporin usage in food animals. Decreasing total antimicrobial use is also of high priority. Implementation of measures to limit strain dissemination (increasing farm biosecurity, controls in animal trade, and other general postharvest controls) are also important.},

abstract = {AIM: Evaluation of the Escherichia coli genome for variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci in order to provide a subtyping tool with greater discrimination and more efficient capacity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-nine putative VNTR loci were identified from the E. coli genomic sequence. Their variability was validated by characterizing the number of repeats at each locus in a set of 56 E. coli O157:H7/HN and O55:H7 isolates. An optimized multiplex assay system was developed to facility high capacity analysis. Locus diversity values ranged from 0.23 to 0.95 while the number of alleles ranged from two to 29. This multiple-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) data was used to describe genetic relationships among these isolates and was compared with PFGE (pulse field gel electrophoresis) data from a subset of the same strains. Genetic similarity values were highly correlated between the two approaches, through MLVA was capable of discrimination amongst closely related isolates when PFGE similar values were equal to 1.0. CONCLUSIONS: Highly variable VNTR loci exist in the E. coli O157:H7 genome and are excellent estimators of genetic relationships, in particular for closely related isolates. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Escherichia coli O157:H7 MLVA offers a complimentary analysis to the more traditional PFGE approach. Application of MLVA to an outbreak cluster could generate superior molecular epidemiology and result in a more effective public health response.},

abstract = {The aim was to investigate occurrence and diversity of plasmid-mediated resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GC) and quinolones in clinical Escherichia coli from 200 industrial poultry farms across Italy. E. coli was isolated from colibacillosis lesions in turkeys (n = 109), broilers (n = 98) and layers (n = 22) between 2008 and 2012. 3GC-resistant isolates were screened for extended-spectrum and AmpC $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL/AmpC), while all isolates were tested for plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. ESBL/AmpC- and PMQR-positive isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and their plasmids were characterised by replicon typing, multilocus sequence typing, restriction fragment length polymorphism and conjugation. EBSL/AmpC genes (blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-14, blaCTX-M-2, blaSHV-12 and blaCMY-2) were detected in 7{\%}, 9{\%} and 4{\%} of isolates from turkeys, broilers and layers, respectively. We identified seven ESBL/AmpC-encoding plasmid types, usually conjugative (78{\%}), with a marked prevalence of IncI1/pST3 plasmids carrying blaCTX-M-1. PMQR occurred less frequently among isolates from turkeys (0.9{\%}) compared to those from broilers (5{\%}) and layers (4{\%}). The PMQR genes qnrS, qnrB19 and oqxA/B were located on three plasmid types and two non-typeable plasmids, mostly (85{\%}) conjugative. ESBL/AmpC- and PMQR-positive isolates were genetically unrelated and 64{\%} of them were additionally resistant to aminoglycosides, sulfonamides and tetracyclines. Our data show that 3GC- and quinolone-resistant clinical E. coli in Italian poultry production represent a highly diverse population often resistant to most antimicrobials available for poultry. These findings underline the crucial need to develop new strategies for prevention and control of colibacillosis.},

These protocols are used by laboratories in PulseNet, a network of state and local health departments, and other public health laboratories that perform real-time PFGE subtyping of these bacterial foodborne pathogens for surveillance and outbreak investigations. Development and standardization of these protocols consisted of a thorough optimization of reagents and reaction conditions to ensure that the protocols yielded consistent results and high-quality PFGE pattern data in all the PulseNet participating laboratories. These rapid PFGE protocols are based on the original 3-4-day standardized procedure developed at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that was validated in 1996 and 1997 by eight independent laboratories. By using these rapid standardized PFGE protocols, PulseNet laboratories are able to subtype foodborne pathogens in approximately 24 h, allowing for the early detection of foodborne disease case clusters and often aiding in the identification of the source responsible for the infections.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131), an emergent multidrug-resistant extraintestinal pathogen, has spread epidemically among humans and was recently isolated from companion animals. To assess for human-companion animal commonality among ST131 isolates, 214 fluoroquinolone-resistant extraintestinal E. coli isolates (205 from humans, 9 from companion animals) from diagnostic laboratories in Australia, provisionally identified as ST131 by PCR, selectively underwent PCR-based O typing and bla(CTX-M-15) detection. A subset then underwent multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis, extended virulence genotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and fluoroquinolone resistance genotyping. All isolates were O25b positive, except for two O16 isolates and one O157 isolate, which (along with six O25b-positive isolates) were confirmed by MLST to be ST131. Only 12{\%} of isolates (25 human, 1 canine) exhibited bla(CTX-M-15). PFGE analysis of 20 randomly selected human and all 9 companion animal isolates showed multiple instances of â¥94{\%} profile similarity across host species; 12 isolates (6 human, 6 companion animal) represented pulsotype 968, the most prevalent ST131 pulsotype in North America (representing 23{\%} of a large ST131 reference collection). Virulence gene and antimicrobial resistance profiles differed minimally, without host species specificity. The analyzed ST131 isolates also exhibited a conserved, host species-independent pattern of chromosomal fluoroquinolone resistance mutations. However, eight (89{\%}) companion animal isolates, versus two (10{\%}) human isolates, possessed the plasmid-borne qnrB gene (P {\textless} 0.001). This extensive across-species strain commonality, plus the similarities between Australian and non-Australian ST131 isolates, suggest that ST131 isolates are exchanged between humans and companion animals both within Australia and intercontinentally.},

abstract = {Broilers and broiler meat products are highly contaminated with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and are considered to be a source for human infections. Both horizontal and vertical transmission might play a role in the presence of these strains in broilers. As not much is known about the presence of these strains in the whole production pyramid, the epidemiology of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in the Dutch broiler production pyramid was examined. Cloacal swabs of Grandparent stock (GPS) birds (one(-)/two-days (breed A and B), 18 and 31 weeks old (breed A)), one-day old Parent stock birds (breed A and B) and broiler chickens of increasing age (breed A) were selectively cultured to detect ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates. ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates were found at all levels in the broiler production pyramid in both broiler breeds examined. Prevalence was already relatively high at the top of the broiler production pyramid. At broiler farms ESBL/AmpC producing E. coli were still present in the environment of the poultry house after cleaning and disinfection. Feed samples taken in the poultry house also became contaminated with ESBL/AmpC producing E. coli after one or more production weeks. The prevalence of ESBL/AmpC-positive birds at broiler farms increased within the first week from 0-24{\%} to 96-100{\%} independent of the use of antibiotics and stayed 100{\%} until slaughter. In GPS breed A, prevalence at 2 days, 18 weeks and 31 weeks stayed below 50{\%} except when beta-lactam antibiotics were administered. In that case prevalence increased to 100{\%}. Interventions minimizing ESBL/AmpC contamination in broilers should focus on preventing horizontal and vertical spread, especially in relation to broiler production farms.},

abstract = {Normalized resistance interpretation (NRI) utilizes the fact that the wild-type population on the sensitive side is not affected by resistance development, and therefore a normalized reconstruction of the peak can be performed. The method was modified for MIC distributions by the introduction of helper variables, in-between values assigned the mean of the neighboring numbers of isolates. This method was used on Staphylo- coccus aureus and Escherichia coli MIC distributions for 27 antimicrobials each and obtained from the EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) website (http://www.eucast.org/mic{\_}distributions/). The number of isolates in each of the 54 distributions ranged from 40 to 124,472. NRI produced normalized distributions in all cases. Cutoff values were calculated for +2.0 and +2.5 standard deviations (SD) above the means and then rounded up to nearest regular MIC dilution step. EUCAST also show cutoff values, ECOFF values, which were used as the reference. The NRI generated +2.0 SD values showed the best agreement with 26 of 27 within Â±1 dilution step and 17 exactly on the ECOFF values for Staphylococcus aureus, and 25 of 27 within Â±1 dilution step and 14 right on the ECOFF values for Escherichia coli. NRI offers an objective method for the reconstruction of the wild-type population in an MIC distribution for a given bacterial species and an antimicrobial agent. This method offers a new tool in comparative susceptibility studies such as global surveillance of resistance, as well as in quality control in individual laboratories.},

abstract = {Domestic animals have been modified by selecting individuals exhibiting desirable traits and culling the others. To investigate the alterations introduced by domestication and selective breeding in heat stress response, 2 experiments were conducted using Red Jungle Fowl (RJF), village fowl (VF), and commercial broilers (CB). In experiment 1, RJF, VF, and CB of a common chronological age (30 d old) were exposed to 36 Â± 1Â°C for 3 h. In experiment 2, RJF, VF, and CB of common BW (930 Â± 15 g) were subjected to similar procedures as in experiment 1. Heat treatment significantly increased body temperature, heterophil:lymphocyte ratio, and plasma corticosterone concentration in CB but not in VF and RJF. In both experiments and irrespective of stage of heat treatment, RJF showed lower heterophil:lymphocyte ratio, higher plasma corticosterone concentration, and higher heat shock protein 70 expression than VF and CB. It can be concluded that selective breeding for phenotypic traits in the domestication process has resulted in alterations in the physiology of CB and concomitantly the ability to withstand high ambient temperature compared with RJF and VF. In other words, domestication and selective breeding are leading to individuals that are more susceptible to stress rather than resistant. It is also apparent that genetic differences in body size and age per se may not determine breed or strain variations in response to heat stress.},

@article{Ariza1995,
abstract = {Multiple antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli can be mediated by induction of the SoxS or MarA protein, triggered by oxygen radicals (in the soxRS regulon) or certain antibiotics (in the marRAB regulon), respectively. These small proteins (SoxS, 107 residues; MarA, 127 residues) are homologous to the C terminus of the XylS-AraC family of proteins and are more closely related to a approximately 100-residue segment in the N terminus of Rob protein, which binds the right arm of the replication origin, oriC. We investigated whether the SoxS-MarA homology in Rob might extend to the regulation of some of the same inducible genes. Overexpression of Rob indeed conferred multiple antibiotic resistance similar to that known for SoxS and MarA (against chloramphenicol, tetracycline, nalidixic acid, and puromycin), as well as resistance to the superoxide-generating compound phenazine methosulfate. The Rob-induced antibiotic resistance depended only partially on the micF antisense RNA that down-regulates the OmpF outer membrane porin to limit antibiotic uptake. Similar antibiotic resistance was conferred by expression of a Rob fragment containing only the N-terminal 123 residues that constitute the SoxS-MarA homology. Both intact Rob and the N-terminal fragment activated expression of stress genes (inaA, fumC, sodA) but with a pattern distinct from that found for SoxS and MarA. Purified Rob protein bound a DNA fragment containing the micF promoter (50{\%} bound at approximately 10(-9) M Rob) as strongly as it did oriC, and it bound more weakly to DNA containing the sodA, nfo, or zwf promoter (50{\%} bound at 10(-8) to 10(-7) M). Rob formed multiple DNA-protein complexes with these fragments, as seen previously for SoxS. These data point to a DNA-binding gene activator module used in different protein contexts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli sequence type ST131 (O25:H4), associated with the CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, has emerged internationally as a multidrug-resistant pathogen but has received little attention in the United States. METHODS: From the SENTRY and Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) surveillance programs, 127 E. coli clinical isolates from hospitalized patients across the United States in 2007, stratified by extended-spectrum cephalosporin and fluoroquinolone phenotype and bla(CTX-M-15) genotype, were assessed for phylogenetic group, ST131 status, susceptibility profile, virulence genotype, gyrA and parC sequence, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profile. RESULTS: The 54 identified ST131 isolates (all fluoroquinolone resistant) accounted for an estimated 17{\%} of the source populations, including 67{\%}-69{\%} of isolates resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, 55{\%} of those resistant to both fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and 52{\%} of multidrug-resistant isolates. Their distinctive virulence profiles were more extensive compared with other antimicrobial-resistant isolates but similarly extensive compared with antimicrobial-susceptible isolates. Pulsed-field profiling suggested ongoing dissemination among locales, with concentration of bla(CTX-M-15) within specific ST131 lineages. A historical ST131 isolate lacked the 2007 ST131 isolates' conserved fluoroquinolone resistance-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms in gyrA and parC. CONCLUSIONS: A single E. coli clonal group, ST131, probably caused the most significantly antimicrobial-resistant E. coli infections in the United States in 2007, thereby constituting an important new public health threat. Enhanced virulence and/or antimicrobial resistance compared with other E. coli, plus ongoing dissemination among locales, may underlie ST131's success. Urgent investigation of the sources and transmission pathways of ST131 is needed to inform mitigation efforts.},

abstract = {The soxR locus of Escherichia coli K12 mediates transcriptional activation of a complex oxidative stress regulon in response to superoxide-generating (redox-cycling) agents. We have cloned the soxR locus, which is positioned near the uvrA gene at 92.2 min on the genetic map, by monitoring complementation of a delta soxR mutation. Subclones from the soxR region in the delta soxR strain simultaneously restored cellular resistance to the redox-cycling agent phenazine methosulfate and inducibility of at least two of the regulon proteins, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and endonuclease IV, by paraquat, another redox-cycling agent. DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of two genes involved in activating the soxR regulon. These genes, named soxR and soxS, are arranged divergently with their 5' ends separated by only 85 bp. The predicted 12.9-kDa SoxS protein is related to the AraC family of one-component gene regulators, but corresponds only to the putative DNA-binding regions of these proteins. The 17.1-kDa SoxR protein bears significant homology only to the MerR family of proteins including a predicted DNA-binding helix-turn-helix and a cluster of cysteine residues positioned similarly to those that regulate the activity of MerR in response to Hg2+. This suggests that SoxR could be a metal-binding gene regulator that acts as the intracellular sensor for superoxide. SoxS is evidently the proximal activator of the regulon genes: antibiotic resistance and high-level expression of at least three of the regulon proteins was effected in vivo by the individual expression of SoxS, but not of SoxR, whether or not the cells were exposed to paraquat. These data, together with the recently reported paraquat-inducibility of the soxS gene (Wu, I., and Weiss, B. (1990) J. Bacteriol. 173, 2864-2871), indicate that SoxR and SoxS may constitute a novel type of two-component regulatory system in which the two proteins act sequentially to activate transcription of the various regulon genes in response to superoxide stress.},

The aim of the present study was to further characterize 24 extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from domestic and imported poultry meat by antibiotic susceptibility testing, identification of the blaESBL/blapAmpC genes, conjugation mating experiments and determination of plasmid incompatibility types, multilocus sequence typing, and analysis of the Escherichia coli phylogenetic groups. On account of their resistance patterns, 21 of the total 24 isolates were classified as multidrug resistant. Eleven isolates carried a blaCMY-2 gene, whereas 13 isolates harbored a blaCTX-M-1 gene. All isolates harbored plasmids that were assigned to 8 of the 18 described plasmid incompatibility groups, the most frequent of which were IncI1, IncFIB, IncB/O, and IncFrepB. The blaESBL/blapAmpC genes were harbored mainly by transferable IncI1 and IncB/O plasmids. Multilocus sequence typing as well as E. coli phylogenetic group typing revealed a high heterogenicity even among different isolates of the same sample.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem of complex epidemiology, suited to a broad, integrated One Health approach. Resistant organisms exist in humans, animals, food and the environment, and the main driver of this resistance is antimicrobial usage. A One Health conceptual framework for surveillance is presented to include all of these aspects. Global and European (regional and national) surveillance systems are described, highlighting shortcomings compared with the framework. Policy decisions rely on economic and scientific evidence, so the business case for a fully integrated system is presented. The costs of integrated surveillance are offset by the costs of unchecked resistance and the benefits arising from interventions and outcomes. Current estimates focus on costs and benefits of human health outcomes. A One Health assessment includes wider societal costs of lost labour, changes in health-seeking behaviour, impacts on animal health and welfare, higher costs of animal-origin food production, and reduced consumer confidence in safety and international trade of such food. Benefits of surveillance may take years to realise and are dependent on effective and accepted interventions. Benefits, including the less tangible, such as improved synergies and efficiencies in service delivery and more timely and accurate risk identification, should also be recognised. By including these less tangible benefits to society, animal welfare, ecosystem health and resilience, together with the savings and efficiencies through shared resources and social capital-building, a stronger business case for a One Health approach to surveillance can be made.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to characterize sets of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae collected longitudinally from different flocks of broiler breeders, meconium of 1-day-old broilers from theses breeder flocks, as well as from these broiler flocks before slaughter. METHODS: Five sets of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli were studied by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), phylogenetic grouping, PCR-based replicon typing and resistance profiling. The bla CTX-M-1-harboring plasmids of one set (pHV295.1, pHV114.1, and pHV292.1) were fully sequenced and subjected to comparative analysis. RESULTS: Eleven different MLST sequence types (ST) were identified with ST1056 the predominant one, isolated in all five sets either on the broiler breeder or meconium level. Plasmid sequencing revealed that bla CTX-M-1 was carried by highly similar IncI1/ST3 plasmids that were 105 076 bp, 110 997 bp, and 117 269 bp in size, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that genetically similar IncI1/ST3 plasmids were found in ESBL-producing E. coli of different MLST types isolated at the different levels in the broiler production pyramid provides strong evidence for a vertical transmission of these plasmids from a common source (nucleus poultry flocks).},

abstract = {Multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in food animals are a potential problem in both animal and human health. In this study, MDR commensal Escherichia coli isolates from poultry were examined. Thirty-two E. coli isolates from broiler carcass rinses were selected based on their resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, chloramphenicols, tetracyclines, and sulfonamide antimicrobials. Microarray analysis for the presence of antimicrobial resistance and plasmid genes identified aminoglycoside [aac(6), aac(3), aadA, aph, strA, and strB], beta-lactam (bla(AmpC), bla(TEM), bla(CMY), and bla(PSE-1)), chloramphenicol (cat, flo, and cmlA), sulfamethoxazole (sulI and sulII), tetracycline [tet(A), tet(C), tet(D), and tetR], and trimethoprim (dfrA) resistance genes. IncA/C plasmid core genes were detected in 27 isolates, while IncHI1 plasmid genes were detected in one isolate, indicating the likely presence of these plasmids. PCR assays for 18 plasmid replicon types often associated with MDR in Enterobacteriaceae also detected one or more replicon types in all 32 isolates. Class I integrons were investigated by PCR amplification of the integrase I gene, intI1, and the cassette region flanked by conserved sequences. Twenty-five isolates were positive for the intI1 gene, and class I integrons ranging in size from {\~{}}1,000 to 3,300 bp were identified in 19 of them. The presence of class I integrons, IncA/C plasmid genes, and MDR-associated plasmid replicons in the isolates indicates the importance of these genetic elements in the accumulation and potential spread of antimicrobial resistance genes in the microbial community associated with poultry.},

If this is true, estimating the real risk of dissemination of resistance genes from environmental reservoirs to human pathogens is therefore very difficult. In this Opinion article, we analyse the current definitions of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic resistance genes, and we describe the bottlenecks that affect the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes to human pathogens. We propose rules for estimating the risks associated with genes that are present in environmental resistomes by evaluating the likelihood of their introduction into human pathogens, and the consequences of such events for the treatment of infections.},

abstract = {Background: In the last decade, the growth of the pig-farming industry has led to an increase in antibiotic use, including several used in human medicine, e.g. (fluoro)quinolones. Data from several studies suggest that there is a link between the agricultural use of antibiotics and the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the pig farm environment, including (fluoro)quinolone resistance. This poses a threat to human and animal health. Our goal was to phenotypically and genotypically characterize 174 E. coli showing non-susceptibility to quinolones isolated from environmental samples from pig farms. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed using the disk diffusion method. PCR and sequence analysis were performed to identify chromosomal mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) of gyrA and the isolates were screened for the presence of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes aac-(6')-Ib-cr, qepA, qnrA, qnrB, qnrC, qnrD and qnrS.Strain relatedness was assessed by phylogenetic classification and multilocus sequence typing (MLST).; Results: Of 174 isolates, 81{\%} (n = 141) were resistant to nalidixic acid, and 19{\%} (n = 33) were intermediately resistant. Overall, 68.4{\%} (n = 119) were multidrug resistant. This study revealed a prevalence of 79.9{\%} (n = 139) for gyrA QRDR mutations, and detected 21.8{\%} (n = 38) isolates with at least one PMQR gene. The two most frequently detected PMQR genes were qnrB and qnrS (13.8{\%} (n = 24) and 9.8{\%} (n = 17, respectively). E. coli belonging to phylogenetic group A (48.3{\%}/n = 84) and group B1 (33.3{\%} /n = 58) were the most frequent. E. coli ST10 (n = 20) and ST297 (n = 20) were the most common STs.; Conclusions: E. coli with non-susceptibility to quinolones are widespread among the environment of Swiss pig farms and are often associated with an MDR phenotype. In several cases these isolates possess at least one PMQR gene, which could spread by horizontal gene transfer. E. coli from pig farms have diverse STs, some of which are associated with human and animal disease.;},

@article{Jacoby2009,
abstract = {SUMMARY: AmpC beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded on the chromosomes of many of the Enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. In many bacteria, AmpC enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. Overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy. Transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for AmpC enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla(AmpC) gene, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Resistance due to plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. AmpC enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. Techniques to identify AmpC beta-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates this resistance mechanism. Carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to AmpC-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance efflux (efflux pump activation).},

The genetic structure of commensal E. coli is shaped by multiple host and environmental factors, and the determinants involved in the virulence of the bacteria may in fact reflect adaptation to commensal habitats. A better characterization of the commensal niche is necessary to understand how a useful commensal can become a harmful pathogen. In this Review we describe the population structure of commensal E. coli, the factors involved in the spread of different strains, how the bacteria can adapt to different niches and how a commensal lifestyle can evolve into a pathogenic one},

abstract = {In the Netherlands, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli bacteria are highly prevalent in poultry, and chicken meat has been implicated as a source of ESBL-producing E. coli present in the human population. The current study describes the isolation of ESBL-producing E. coli from house flies and blow flies caught at two poultry farms, offering a potential alternative route of transmission of ESBL-producing E. coli from poultry to humans. Overall, 87 flies were analyzed in 19 pools. ESBL-producing E. coli bacteria were detected in two fly pools (10.5{\%}): a pool of three blow flies from a broiler farm and a pool of eight house flies from a laying-hen farm. From each positive fly pool, six isolates were characterized and compared with isolates obtained from manure (n = 53) sampled at both farms and rinse water (n = 10) from the broiler farm. Among six fly isolates from the broiler farm, four different types were detected with respect to phylogenetic group, sequence type (ST), and ESBL genotype: A0/ST3519/SHV-12, A1/ST10/SHV-12, A1/ST58/SHV-12, and B1/ST448/CTX-M-1. These types, as well as six additional types, were also present in manure and/or rinse water at the same farm. At the laying-hen farm, all fly and manure isolates were identical, carrying blaTEM-52 in an A1/ST48 genetic background. The data imply that flies acquire ESBL-producing E. coli at poultry farms, warranting further evaluation of the contribution of flies to dissemination of ESBL-producing E. coli in the community.},

Our analysis subdivides S. flexneri into seven phylogenetic groups (PGs); each containing two-or-more serotypes and characterised by distinct virulence gene complement and geographic range. Within the S. flexneri PGs we identify geographically restricted sub-lineages that appear to have persistently colonised regions for many decades to over 100 years. Although we found abundant evidence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinant acquisition, our dataset shows no evidence of subsequent intercontinental spread of antimicrobial resistant strains.

ST131 is known to cause extraintestinal infections, being fluoroquinolone resistant, and is associated with ESBL production most often due to CTX-M-15. Recent molecular epidemiologic studies using whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis have demonstrated that the H30 ST131 lineage emerged in early 2000s that was followed by the rapid expansion of its sublineages H30-R and H30-Rx. Escherichia coli ST131 clearly has all of the essential characteristics that define a high-risk clone and might be the quintessential example of an international multiresistant high-risk clone. We urgently need rapid cost-effective detection methods for E. coli ST131, as well as well-designed epidemiological and molecular studies to understand the dynamics of transmission, risk factors, and reservoirs for ST131. This will provide insight into the emergence and spread of this multiresistant sequence type that will hopefully lead to information essential for preventing the spread of ST131.},

abstract = {The presence of an abnormal amount of single-stranded DNA in the bacterial cell constitutes a genotoxic alarm signal that induces the SOS response, a broad regulatory network found in most bacterial species to address DNA damage. The aim of this review was to point out that beyond being a repair process, SOS induction leads to a very strong but transient response to genotoxic stress, during which bacteria can rearrange and mutate their genome, induce several phenotypic changes through differential regulation of genes, and sometimes acquire characteristics that potentiate bacterial survival and adaptation to changing environments. We review here the causes and consequences of SOS induction, but also how this response can be modulated under various circumstances and how it is connected to the network of other important stress responses. In the first section, we review articles describing the induction of the SOS response at the molecular level. The second section discusses consequences of this induction in terms of DNA repair, changes in the genome and gene expression, and sharing of genomic information, with their effects on the bacteria{\&}{\#}039;s life and evolution. The third section is about the fine tuning of this response to fit with the bacteria{\&}{\#}039;s âneeds'. Finally, we discuss recent findings linking the SOS response to other stress responses. Under these perspectives, SOS can be perceived as a powerful bacterial strategy against aggressions.Keywords},

abstract = {Integrons are genetic elements that contain a site-specific recombination system able to capture, express and exchange gene cassettes. Mobile integrons are widespread and often confer resistance to multiple antibiotics, due to the expression of the arrays of gene cassettes they carry. Although {\textgreater}300 cassette arrays have been described, {\textless}10 array compositions prevail in the reports related to class 1 integrons. These common arrays are found in a broad variety of hosts and environments, highlighting the high level of horizontal dissemination of these elements amongst bacterial populations and species. Clonal expansion also contributes to the current prevalence and inter-regional spread of integron-carrying bacterial species. Here, we review the dissemination pattern of common cassette arrays with a focus on the bacterial species, the geographical dispersal pattern and the environments in which they reside. Conserved arrays of gene cassettes are found in at least 74 countries and 72 species present in different environments. The factors governing the further spread and population dynamics of these cassette arrays remain to be determined.},

@article{Nikaido1998,
abstract = {Multiple antibiotic resistance in bacteria was at first thought to be caused exclusively by the combination of several resistance genes, each coding for resistance to a single drug. More recently, it became clear that such phenotypes are often achieved by the activity of drug efflux pumps. Some of these efflux pumps exhibit an extremely wide specificity covering practically all antibiotics, chemotherapeutic agents, detergents, dyes, and other inhibitors, the exception perhaps being very hydrophilic compounds. Such efflux pumps work with exceptional efficiency in Gram-negative bacteria through their synergistic interaction with the outer membrane barrier. It is disturbing that the antibacterial agents of the most advanced type, which are unaffected by common resistance mechanisms, are the compounds whose use appears to select for multidrug-resistant mutants that overproduce these efflux pumps of wide specificity.},

abstract = {The contribution of regulatory genes to fluoroquinolone resistance was studied with clinical Escherichia coli strains bearing mutations in gyrA and parC and with different levels of fluoroquinolone resistance. Expression of marA and soxS was evaluated by Northern blot analysis of isolates that demonstrated increased organic solvent tolerance, a phenotype that has been linked to overexpression of marA, soxS, and rob. Among 25 cyclohexane-tolerant strains detected by a screen for increased organic solvent tolerance (M. Oethinger, W. V. Kern, J. D. Goldman, and S. B. Levy, J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 41:111-114, 1998), we found 5 Mar mutants and 4 Sox mutants. A further Mar mutant was detected among 11 fluoroquinolone-resistant, cyclohexane-susceptible E. coli strains used as controls. Comparison of the marOR sequences of clinical Mar mutants with that of E. coli K-12 (GenBank accession no. M96235) revealed point mutations in marR in all mutants which correlated with loss of repressor function as detected in a marO::lacZ transcriptional assay. We found four other amino acid changes in MarR that did not lead to loss of function. Two of these changes, present in 20 of the 35 sequenced marOR fragments, identified a variant genotype of marOR. Isolates with the same gyrA and parC mutations showed increased fluoroquinolone resistance when the mutations were accompanied by overexpression of marA or soxS. These data support the hypothesis that high-level fluoroquinolone resistance involves mutations at several chromosomal loci, comprising structural and regulatory genes.},

abstract = {Microcin B17 (MccB17) is a peptide antibiotic which inhibits DNA replication in Enterobacteriaceae. Microcin-producing strains are immune to the action of the microcin. Physical and genetic studies showed that immunity is mediated by three genes: mcbE, mcbF and mcbG. We sequenced these genes and identified polypeptide products for mcbF and mcbG. By studying the contribution of each gene to the expression of immunity we found that immunity is determined by two different mechanisms. One of these, encoded by mcbE and mcbF, is also involved in the production of extracellular MccB17. To reconcile these observations we propose that McbE and McbF serve as a 'pump' for the export of active MccB17 from the cytoplasm. This model is supported by the predicted properties of the McbE and McbF proteins, which are thought to be, respectively, an integral membrane protein and an ATP-binding protein with homology to other transport proteins.},

Many outbreaks have been found to be associated with biofilm. It is well documented that biofilm has become a problem in food industries as it renders its inhabitants resistant to antimicrobial agents and cleaning. In this review, biofilm formation in dairy, fish processing, poultry, meat, and Ready-To-Eat foods industries are discussed, as well as the biofilm forming abilities' of various microorganisms and the influence of food contact surface materials on biofilm formation. In addition, the conventional and emergent control strategies used to gain more proximity to efficiently maintain good hygiene throughout food industries is discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Advances in modern sequencing technologies allow us to generate sufficient data to analyze hundreds of bacterial genomes from a single machine in a single day. This potential for sequencing massive numbers of genomes calls for fully automated methods to produce high-quality assemblies and variant calls. We introduce Pilon, a fully automated, all-in-one tool for correcting draft assemblies and calling sequence variants of multiple sizes, including very large insertions and deletions. Pilon works with many types of sequence data, but is particularly strong when supplied with paired end data from two Illumina libraries with small e.g., 180 bp and large e.g., 3-5 Kb inserts. Pilon significantly improves draft genome assemblies by correcting bases, fixing mis-assemblies and filling gaps. For both haploid and diploid genomes, Pilon produces more contiguous genomes with fewer errors, enabling identification of more biologically relevant genes. Furthermore, Pilon identifies small variants with high accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art tools and is unique in its ability to accurately identify large sequence variants including duplications and resolve large insertions. Pilon is being used to improve the assemblies of thousands of new genomes and to identify variants from thousands of clinically relevant bacterial strains. Pilon is freely available as open source software.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate chicken and pork meat sampled at the slaughterhouse and at retail for differences in the presence of antibiotic resistant Gram-negative bacteria. For this aim, Escherichia coli (n=677), Enterobacter spp. (n=167), Citrobacter spp. (n=83), Serratia spp. (n=116), Klebsiella spp. (n=125), and Salmonella spp. (n=89) were isolated from 500 chicken and 500 pork samples purchased at the slaughterhouse and at retail (in the same amounts) in Germany. Salmonella were present in 17{\%} of the chicken, and in 0.4{\%} of the pork meat samples. There was a clear shift in the spectrum of coliforms from slaughterhouse to retail: Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Klebsiella were the most frequently detected coliforms (other than E. coli) from slaughterhouse samples, whereas the prevalence of Serratia spp. was up to eight times higher in retail samples. The prevalence of E. coli was higher in slaughterhouse samples, whereas the prevalence of other coliforms and Salmonella spp. was higher in retail samples. E. coli strains were often resistant to penicillins, streptomycin, spectinomycin, doxycycline and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Resistance rates of the other coliforms were generally low. Resistant and multi-resistant isolates were significantly more common in chicken meat. Compared to samples from the slaughterhouse, the prevalence of resistant bacteria tended to be higher in retail samples, probably due to good conditions for resistant bacteria on the matrix meat and/or due to secondary contamination with resistant strains. Therefore, stringent hygiene measures should be observed to reduce the risk of transmission of resistant bacteria from food to humans.},

abstract = {Quinolone resistance encoded by the qnr gene and mediated by plasmid pMG252 was discovered in a clinical strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae that was isolated in 1994 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Medical Center. The gene codes for a protein that protects DNA gyrase from quinolone inhibition and that belongs to the pentapeptide repeat family of proteins. The prevalence of the gene has been investigated by using PCR with qnr-specific primers with a sample of more than 350 gram-negative strains that originated in 18 countries and 24 states in the United States and that included many strains with plasmid-mediated AmpC or extended spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes. qnr was found in isolates from the University of Alabama at Birmingham only during 6 months in 1994, despite the persistence of the gene for FOX-5 beta-lactamase, which is linked to qnr on pMG252. Isolates from other locations were negative for qnr. The prevalence of mcbG in the same sample was also examined. mcbG encodes another member of the pentapeptide repeat family and is involved in immunity to microcin B17, which, like quinolones, targets DNA gyrase. A single clinical isolate contained mcbG on a transmissible R plasmid. This plasmid and one carrying the complete microcin B17 operon slightly decreased sparfloxacin susceptibility but had a much less protective effect than pMG252. Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance was thus rare in the sample examined.},

All isolates with a MIC of nalidixic acid of {\textgreater} or = 128 micrograms/ml showed a mutation at amino acid codon Ser-83. Only 1 of the 27 clinical isolates of E. coli analyzed showed a change in Lys-447 of the B subunit of DNA gyrase. A change in Ser-83 is sufficient to generate a high level of resistance to nalidixic acid, whereas a second mutation at Asp-87 in the A subunit of DNA gyrase may play a complementary role in developing the strain's high levels of ciprofloxacin resistance.},

abstract = {Postsegregational killing (PSK) systems consist of a tightly linked toxin-antitoxin pair. Antitoxin must be continually produced to prevent the longer lived toxin from killing the cell. PSK systems on plasmids are widely believed to benefit the plasmid by ensuring its stable vertical inheritance. However, experimental tests of this "stability" hypothesis were not consistent with its predictions. We suggest an alternative hypothesis to explain the evolution of PSK: that PSK systems have been selected through benefiting host plasmids in environments where plasmids must compete during horizontal reproduction. In this "competition" hypothesis, success of PSK systems is a consequence of plasmid-plasmid competition, rather than from an adaptive plasmid-host relationship. In support of this hypothesis, a plasmid-encoded parDE PSK system mediated the exclusion of an isogenic DeltaparDE plasmid. An understanding of how PSK systems influence plasmid success may provide insight into the evolution of other determinants (e.g., antibiotic resistance and virulence) also rendering a cell potentially dependent on an otherwise dispensable plasmid.},

abstract = {The discovery of nalidixic acid in 1962, and its introduction for clinical use in 1967, marks the beginning of five decades of quinolone development and use. It was not until the discovery and licensing of the fluoroquinolones in the 1970s and 1980s that these drugs began to establish their place in the armamentarium of clinically useful antimicrobials. At the beginning of the 21st century, in their fifth decade of discovery and use, our understanding of structure-function relationships has improved, and better compounds, in terms of both spectrum of antimicrobial cover and pharmacokinetics, have been developed. The clinical utility of this expanding class of antimicrobial agents, and the lower propensity for the development of resistance with the "newer" fluoroquinolones will need to be continually monitored in the changing therapeutic environment. Antibiotic drug choice will remain difficult in the presence of increasing resistance, but the introduction of the new fluoroquinolones has created a new and exciting era in antimicrobial treatment. The role of these agents has already been acknowledged in a number of clinical guidelines, and appropriate use of these agents may help to preserve their clinical utility, enabling them to realize their full therapeutic potential.},

abstract = {Fluoroquinolones are antibacterial drugs that inhibit DNA Gyrase and Topoisomerase IV. These essential enzymes facilitate chromosome replication and RNA transcription by regulating chromosome supercoiling. High-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in E. coli requires the accumulation of multiple mutations, including those that alter target genes and genes regulating drug efflux. Previous studies have shown some drug-resistance mutations reduce bacterial fitness, leading to the selection of fitness-compensatory mutations. The impact of fluoroquinolone-resistance on bacterial fitness was analyzed in constructed isogenic strains carrying up to 5 resistance mutations. Some mutations significantly decreased bacterial fitness both in vitro and in vivo. We identified low-fitness triple-mutants where the acquisition of a fourth resistance mutation significantly increased fitness in vitro and in vivo while at the same time dramatically decreasing drug susceptibility. The largest effect occurred with the addition of a parC mutation (Topoisomerase IV) to a low-fitness strain carrying resistance mutations in gyrA (DNA Gyrase) and marR (drug efflux regulation). Increased fitness was accompanied by a significant change in the level of gyrA promoter activity as measured in an assay of DNA supercoiling. In selection and competition experiments made in the absence of drug, parC mutants that improved fitness and reduced susceptibility were selected. These data suggest that natural selection for improved growth in bacteria with low-level resistance to fluoroquinolones could in some cases select for further reductions in drug susceptibility. Thus, increased resistance to fluoroquinolones could be selected even in the absence of further exposure to the drug.},

A field study was performed to investigate the presence and characteristics of ciprofloxacin-resistant, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC Escherichia coli from turkeys in Great Britain. E. coli were isolated from {\~{}}9000 boot swab samples from 27 different farms owned by four different companies. Between 1 and 14 visits were made to each farm (mean 3) at between 0 and 15 m intervals (mean {\~{}}5 m). 2. CHROMagar ECC with and without ciprofloxacin or cephalosporin antibiotics was used as selective isolation media. Representative isolates with different phenotypes were tested for mutations in gyrA and for: qnrA, B, S, qepA and aac(6')-Ib genes, for ESBL phenotype, the presence of bla genes and plasmid type, and for ampC genes Representative ciprofloxacin-resistant and CTX-M isolates were further tested for serotype and PFGE type. On ciprofloxacin selective media 55{\%} of samples yielded ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli and of those further analysed, most had ciprofloxacin MICs {\textgreater}4 mg/l and mutations in gyrA. 3. For the different companies, the mean number of samples per farm with cefoxitin- or cefotaxime-resistant isolates ranged from 1.0{\%} to 61.9{\%} and 4.7{\%} to 31.7{\%} respectively. Cefotaxime-resistance was most commonly associated with an ESBL phenotype, a CTX-M-1 or CTX-M-14 sequence type and an I1-gamma or K plasmid inc type. The mechanism of cefoxitin resistance was not determined for most isolates, but where determined it was bla . 4. PFGE and serotyping showed clonally-related isolates persisting over multiple visits suggesting both more prudent use of antibiotics and improved farm hygiene are needed to address the issue of antimicrobial resistance in isolates from turkeys.},

Only 20{\%} (65/329) of the mutants selected from the transconjugants showed a gyrase mutation, whereas 79{\%} (94/119) of those from the reference strains without a qnr gene did (P {\textless} 0.0001). At four times the MIC of the selector quinolone, gyrA mutants represented 49{\%} and 95{\%} of the mutants selected with nalidixic acid, 4{\%} and 94{\%} with ciprofloxacin and 0{\%} and 54{\%} with moxifloxacin for qnr-positive transconjugants and reference strains, respectively. Mutations within gyrA were distributed at codon 87 (D87G, H, N or Y) and at codon 83 (S83L) with three novel mutations (gyrA Ser83stop, gyrA Asp82Asn and gyrB insertion of Glu at 465) and three rare mutations (gyrA Gly81Asp, gyrA Asp82Gly and gyrA Ser431Pro), mainly obtained from reference strains after moxifloxacin selection. Strikingly, none of the mutants selected by moxifloxacin from qnr-positive transconjugants harboured a mutation in the topoisomerase genes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Topoisomerase mutants are rarely selected by ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin from strains harbouring qnr. This suggests that the quinolone resistance-determining region domains are protected from quinolones by the Qnr protein and consequently other mechanisms are developed to acquire a further step of fluoroquinolone resistance.},

abstract = {An epidemiological investigation was conducted to identify risk factors related to hygiene and husbandry practices which determine the introduction of Campylobacter spp. into broiler chicken flocks. All 176 broiler farms in an area in southeastern Norway participated in the study. Each farm was represented by one flock selected at random during a one-year period. The flocks were examined for campylobacter colonization at slaughter, and the flock managers were subsequently interviewed about hygiene and husbandry practices. Campylobacter spp. were recovered from 32 (18{\%}) of the flocks. The proportion of colonized flocks varied geographically and seasonally with a peak in the autumn. The following variables were found to be independently associated with an increased risk of campylobacter colonization using logistic regression analysis: (i) feeding the broilers undisinfected water (odds ratio (OR) = 3.42, P = 0.045), (ii) tending other poultry prior to entering the broiler house (OR = 6.43, P = 0.007), (iii) tending pigs before entering the house (OR = 4.86, P = 0.037), (iv) geographic region (Hedmark versus Ostfold county) (OR = 2.91, P = 0.023, (v) season (autumn versus other seasons) (OR = 3.43; P = 0.008). Presence of rats on the farm was associated with an increased risk, but this factor did not reach statistical significance (OR = 3.96, P = 0.083). Preventive measures should include disinfection of drinking water and strict hygienic routines when the farm workers enter the rearing room. The results indicate that disinfection of drinking water is the preventive measure most likely to have the greatest impact on the prevalence of campylobacter among broiler chicken flocks in the study area (population attributable fraction = 0.53).},

The aac (6â²)-Ib gene was detected in qnr-bearing strains by PCR and sequencing. For all strains carrying qnr, MICs for six quinolones were determined. Mutations within the gyrase and topoisomerase were analyzed by PCR and sequencing for all the QRDRs of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE. Among 232 E. coli isolates, 14 (6{\%}) isolates were positive for the qnr gene, including one for qnrB, 13 for qnrS, but no qnrA was identified in this population. Detection of the aac (6â²)-Ib gene showed that one qnrS-positive isolate from pig and one qnrB-positive isolate from duck carried aac (6â²)-Ib gene, and both were the cr variant allele of aac (6â²)-Ib. All of the 14 isolates had MICs of ciprofloxacin more than 0.25 mg/L. Mutations in the QRDR of gyrA mutations were observed in 5 (35.7{\%}) of the 14 strains. Three fluoroquinolone-resisting strains showed one mutation S83L of gyrA, while one S83I. One high-level resistance strains harboured gyrA S83L and A87N of gyrA.

@article{Tran2005,
abstract = {Quinolone resistance normally arises by mutations in the chromosomal genes for type II topoisomerases and by changes in the expression of proteins that control the accumulation of quinolones inside bacteria. A novel mechanism of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance was recently reported that involves DNA gyrase protection by a pentapeptide repeat family member called Qnr. This family includes two other members, McbG and MfpA, that are also involved in resistance to gyrase inhibitors. Purified Qnr-His6 was shown to protect Escherichia coli DNA gyrase directly from inhibition by ciprofloxacin. Here we have provided a biochemical basis for the mechanism of quinolone resistance. We have shown that Qnr can bind to the gyrase holoenzyme and its respective subunits, GyrA and GyrB. The binding of Qnr to gyrase does not require the presence of the complex of enzyme, DNA, and quinolone, since binding occurred in the absence of relaxed DNA, ciprofloxacin, or ATP. We hypothesize that the formation of Qnr-gyrase complex occurs before the formation of the cleavage complex. Furthermore, there was a decrease in DNA binding by gyrase when the enzyme interacted with Qnr. Therefore, it is possible that the reaction intermediate recognized by Qnr is one early in the gyrase catalytic cycle, in which gyrase has just begun to interact with DNA. Quinolones bind later in the catalytic cycle and stabilize a ternary complex consisting of the drug, gyrase, and DNA. By lowering gyrase binding to DNA, Qnr may reduce the amount of holoenzyme-DNA targets for quinolone inhibition.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli is an important pathogen of animals and humans that causes great financial cost in food production by causing disease in food animals. The quinolones are a class of synthetic antimicrobial agents with excellent activity against Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria used in human and veterinary medicine. Different quinolones are used to treat various conditions in animals in different parts of the world. All members of this class of drug have the same mode of action: inhibition of topoisomerase enzymes, DNA Gyrase and Topoisomerase IV. Escherichia coli can become resistant to quinolones by altering the target enzymes, reducing permeability of the cell to inhibit their entry, or by actively pumping the drug out of the cell. All these resistance mechanisms can play a role in high-level fluoroquinolone resistance, however target site mutations appear to be most important. As all quinolones act in the same way resistance to one member of the class will also confer decreased susceptibility to all members of the family. Quinolone resistant Escherichia coli in animals have increased in numbers after quinolone introduction in a number of different case studies. The resistance mechanisms in these isolates are the same as those in resistant strains found in humans. Care needs to be taken to ensure that quinolones are used sparingly and appropriately as highly resistant strains of Escherichia coli can be selected and may pass into the food chain. As these drugs are of major therapeutic importance in human medicine, this is a public health concern. More information as to the numbers of quinolone resistant Escherichia coli and the relationship between resistance and quinolone use is needed to allow us to make better informed decisions about when and when not to use quinolones in the treatment of animals.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED Biocides, such as herbicides, are routinely tested for toxicity but not for sublethal effects on microbes. Many biocides are known to induce an adaptive multiple-antibiotic resistance phenotype. This can be due to either an increase in the expression of efflux pumps, a reduced synthesis of outer membrane porins, or both. Exposures of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to commercial formulations of three herbicides-dicamba (Kamba), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and glyphosate (Roundup)-were found to induce a changed response to antibiotics. Killing curves in the presence and absence of sublethal herbicide concentrations showed that the directions and the magnitudes of responses varied by herbicide, antibiotic, and species. When induced, MICs of antibiotics of five different classes changed up to 6-fold. In some cases the MIC increased, and in others it decreased. Herbicide concentrations needed to invoke the maximal response were above current food maximum residue levels but within application levels for all herbicides. Compounds that could cause induction had additive effects in combination. The role of soxS, an inducer of the AcrAB efflux pump, was tested in $\beta$-galactosidase assays with soxS-lacZ fusion strains of E. coli. Dicamba was a moderate inducer of the sox regulon. Growth assays with Phe-Arg $\beta$-naphtylamide (PA$\beta$N), an efflux pump inhibitor, confirmed a significant role of efflux in the increased tolerance of E. coli to chloramphenicol in the presence of dicamba and to kanamycin in the presence of glyphosate. Pathways of exposure with relevance to the health of humans, domestic animals, and critical insects are discussed. IMPORTANCE Increasingly common chemicals used in agriculture, domestic gardens, and public places can induce a multiple-antibiotic resistance phenotype in potential pathogens. The effect occurs upon simultaneous exposure to antibiotics and is faster than the lethal effect of antibiotics. The magnitude of the induced response may undermine antibiotic therapy and substantially increase the probability of spontaneous mutation to higher levels of resistance. The combination of high use of both herbicides and antibiotics in proximity to farm animals and important insects, such as honeybees, might also compromise their therapeutic effects and drive greater use of antibiotics. To address the crisis of antibiotic resistance requires broadening our view of environmental contributors to the evolution of resistance.},

Bayesian analysis of recombination within the core genome identified reduction in detectable core genome recombination as one moves from the commensals, through the intestinal pathogens down to the multidrug-resistant extraintestinal pathogenic clone E. coli ST131.

abstract = {The aim of the study was to identify the plasmid-encoded factors contributing to the emergence and spread of epidemic IncI1-Igamma plasmids obtained from Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica isolates from animal and human reservoirs. For this, 251 IncI1-Igamma plasmids carrying various extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC beta-lactamase genes were compared using plasmid multilocus sequence typing (pMLST). Thirty-two of these plasmids belonging to different pMLST types were sequenced using Roche 454 and Illumina platforms. Epidemic IncI1-Igamma plasmids could be assigned to various dominant clades, whereas rarely detected plasmids clustered together as a distinct clade. Similar phylogenetic trees were obtained using only the plasmid backbone sequences, showing that the differences observed between the plasmids belonging to distinct clades resulted mainly from differences between their backbone sequences. Plasmids belonging to the various clades differed particularly in the presence/absence of genes encoding partitioning and addiction systems, which contribute to stable inheritance during cell division and plasmid maintenance. Despite this, plasmids belonging to the various phylogenetic clades also showed marked resistance gene associations, indicating the circulation of successful plasmid-gene combinations. The variation in traY and excA genes found in IncI1-Igamma plasmids is conserved within pMLST sequence types and plays a role in incompatibility, although functional study is needed to elucidate the role of these genes in plasmid epidemiology.},

abstract = {In Escherichia coli the frequency of spontaneous single-step mutation to high levels of resistance to the newer 4-quinolone agent norfloxacin was confirmed to be over 300-fold lower than that to the older agent nalidixic acid. Serial passage on incremental concentrations of drug was necessary to produce mutants highly resistant to norfloxacin. Genetic analysis of one such highly resistant strain identified two mutations conferring drug resistance. One mutation, nfxA, mapped around 48 min on the E. coli genetic map and was shown to be an allele of gyrA by studies demonstrating an increased drug resistance of DNA gyrase reconstituted with the gyrase A subunit isolated from the mutant strain. These findings also identified the DNA gyrase A subunit as a target of norfloxacin. The second mutation, nfxB, mapped between 20 and 22 min was associated with additional resistances to tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and cefoxitin and with decreases in outer membrane porin protein OmpF. The nfxA and nfxB mutations together accounted for most, but not all, of the norfloxacin resistance phenotype of this strain.},

This study was designed to examine the specificity of DNA gyrase inhibitors of various chemical classes in these two DNA gyrase assays, and define the use of these two assays in understanding the nature of inhibition by experimental compounds. Supercoiling inhibition was detected by determination of the 50{\%} inhibition level, and cleavable complex inhibition measured by the determination of the drug concentration at which 50{\%} of the maximal (of control) formation of linear, cleaved DNA was obtained. Results indicate that these two assays can serve several different functions in microbiological research, among them: (1) quantitation of enzyme inhibitory activity at the target level; and (2) distinguishing between nonspecific inhibition or artifactual inhibition of DNA gyrase and true, mechanism-based inhibition of the catalytic activity of DNA gyrase.},

abstract = {In terms of evolution and fitness, the most significant spontaneous mutation rate is likely to be that for the entire genome (or its nonfrivolous fraction). Information is now available to calculate this rate for several DNA-based haploid microbes, including bacteriophages with single- or double-stranded DNA, a bacterium, a yeast, and a filamentous fungus. Their genome sizes vary by approximately 6500-fold. Their average mutation rates per base pair vary by approximately 16,000-fold, whereas their mutation rates per genome vary by only approximately 2.5-fold, apparently randomly, around a mean value of 0.0033 per DNA replication. The average mutation rate per base pair is inversely proportional to genome size. Therefore, a nearly invariant microbial mutation rate appears to have evolved. Because this rate is uniform in such diverse organisms, it is likely to be determined by deep general forces, perhaps by a balance between the usually deleterious effects of mutation and the physiological costs of further reducing mutation rates.},

The use of MacConkey agar supplemented with cefotaxime (2 mg/L) increased the recovery of resistant strains up to 33.3{\%} of samples from pigs, 42.3{\%} from layers, 48.0{\%} from turkey, and 54.5{\%} from broilers. Still, no cephalosporin-resistant E. coli was found in cattle. E-test identified extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and ampC-type resistance phenotypes in 15 and 33 strains, respectively. Molecular characterization identified CTX-M-1 gene in 13 ESBL strains, 5 of which possessed also TEM-1b. One strain harbored SHV-12 gene. CMY-2 was found in all of 20 tested ampC-type cephalosporinase-positive strains either alone (n = 14) or in combination with mutations in ampC promoter region (n = 6). CTX-M-1 and CMY-2 genes were noted also in five strains from laying hens and broilers originated from Belgium and Germany. Nosocomial infections in Poland are caused by E. coli carrying other determinants than those found in our study. Thus, our results indicate that animals colonized with cephalosporin-resistant strains might not be the major source of human infections in Poland. However, the contribution to community-acquired infections by spread of resistant clones or resistance genes may not be excluded.},

However, rapid and reliable comparison of data generated in multiple laboratories and using multiple technologies is essential. So far studies have focused on using one technology because each technology has a systematic bias making integration of data generated from different platforms difficult. We developed two different procedures for identifying variable sites and inferring phylogenies in WGS data across multiple platforms. The methods were evaluated on three bacterial data sets and sequenced on three different platforms (Illumina, 454, Ion Torrent). We show that the methods are able to overcome the systematic biases caused by the sequencers and infer the expected phylogenies. It is concluded that the cause of the success of these new procedures is due to a validation of all informative sites that are included in the analysis. The procedures are available as web tools.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tackling multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli requires evidence from One Health studies that capture numerous potential reservoirs in circumscribed geographic areas., METHODS: We conducted a survey of extended beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolated from patients, canals and livestock wastewater in eastern Thailand between 2014 and 2015, and analyzed isolates using whole genome sequencing., RESULTS: The bacterial collection of 149 isolates consisted of 84 isolates from a single hospital and 65 from the hospital sewer, canals and farm wastewater within a 20 km radius. E. coli ST131 predominated the clinical collection (28.6{\%}), but was uncommon in the environment. Genome-based comparison of E. coli from infected patients and their immediate environment indicated low genetic similarity overall between the two, although three clinical-environmental isolate pairs differed by{\textless}=5 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Thai E. coli isolates were dispersed throughout a phylogenetic tree containing a global E. coli collection. All Thai ESBL-positive E. coli isolates were multidrug resistant, including high rates of resistance to tobramycin (77.2{\%}), gentamicin (77.2{\%}), ciprofloxacin (67.8{\%}) and trimethoprim (68.5{\%}). ESBL was encoded by six different CTX-M elements and SHV-12. Three isolates from clinical samples (n=2) or a hospital sewer (n=1) were resistant to the carbapenem drugs (encoded by NDM-1, NDM-5 or GES-5), and three isolates (clinical (n=1) and canal water (n=2)) were resistant to colistin (encoded by mcr-1); no isolates were resistant to both carbapenems and colistin., CONCLUSIONS: Tackling ESBL-producing E. coli in this setting will be challenging based on widespread distribution, but the low prevalence of resistance to carbapenems and colistin suggests that efforts are now required to prevent these from becoming ubiquitous.},

abstract = {Chromosomally encoded systems involved in low level resistance of bacteria to different classes of antibiotics (mainly ??-lactams, chloramphenicol, quinolones and tetracycline), disinfectants and in resistance to organic solvents have been the focus of considerable interest in recent years. The multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) locus of Escherichia coli and Salmonella is perhaps the best described system involved in this type of resistance which is induced by MarA, the activator protein encoded by the marRAB locus. The mar-locus is reported to mediate resistance primarily by up-regulating efflux of some antibiotics, disinfectants and organic solvents via the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump and down regulating influx through Outer Membrane Protein F (OmpF). Whilst the level of antibiotic resistance conferred by marRAB is only low level, there are increasing data to suggest that marRAB and related systems are important in clinical antibiotic resistance, possibly as a 'stepping stone' to higher levels of resistance. Other related systems include up-regulation of RobA, SoxS and AcrAB which give rise to a similar resistance phenotype to that conferred by up-regulation of MarA. The aim of this paper is to review the function and significance of the mar-locus and related systems with a particular focus on its implications in veterinary medicine. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

@article{Zurfluh2015b,
abstract = {One of the currently most important antibiotic resistance mechanisms in Enterobacteriaceae is based on the production of ESBL enzymes that inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics including cephalosporins and monobactams by hydrolyzing their beta-lactam ring. In humans, the most prevalent ESBL enzyme type is encoded by blaCTX-M-15. CTX-M-15 producing enterobacterial strains were also frequently isolated from environmental samples including surface water and freshwater fish. Plasmids, which can be grouped in different plasmid incompatibility types, play a key role in the horizontal spread of these multidrug resistance genes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the diversity of plasmids that carry blaCTX-M-15 genes among Enterobacteriaceae isolated at the environment, livestock and human interface. In total, 81 blaCTX-M-15-harboring isolates collected between 2009 and 2014 were tested for its ability to transfer blaCTX-M-15 by conjugation. These plasmids were further typed. Transfer of a single blaCTX-M-15-harboring plasmid was observed in 32 (39.5{\%}) of the isolates. The most frequent replicon types detected among these plasmids are IncF-type plasmids (n=12) (mostly multi replicon plasmids with a combination of following replicons: IncFII, IncFIA and IncFIB), followed by IncI1 (n=8), IncK (n=3) and IncR (n=1). A noticeable number of plasmids (n=8) could not be assigned to any of the tested replicon types. Knowledge about the plasmid types circulating in bacterial populations is indispensable for understanding epidemiological dynamics and for establishing intervention strategies to stop further dissemination of particular plasmids.},

abstract = {Wildlife is normally not exposed to clinically used antimicrobial agents but can acquire antimicrobial resistant bacteria through contact with humans, domesticated animals and the environment, where water polluted with feces seems to be the most important vector. Escherichia coli, an ubiquitous commensal bacterial species colonizing the intestinal tract of mammals and birds, is also found in the environment. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases producing E. coli (ESBL-E. coli) represent a major problem in human and veterinary medicine, particular in nosocomial infections. Additionally an onset of community-acquired ESBL-E. coli infections and an emergence in livestock farming has been observed in recent years, suggesting a successful transmission as well as persistence of ESBL-E. coli strains outside clinical settings. Another parallel worldwide phenomenon is the spread of ESBL-E. coli into the environment beyond human and domesticated animal populations, and this seems to be directly influenced by antibiotic practice. This might be a collateral consequence of the community-onset of ESBL-E. coli infections but can result (a) in a subsequent colonization of wild animal populations which can turn into an infectious source or even a reservoir of ESBL-E. coli, (b) in a contribution of wildlife to the spread and transmission of ESBL-E. coli into fragile environmental niches, (c) in new putative infection cycles between wildlife, domesticated animals and humans, and (d) in problems in the medical treatment of wildlife. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on ESBL-E. coli in wildlife, in turn underlining the need for more large scale investigations, in particular sentinel studies to monitor the impact of multiresistant bacteria on wildlife.},

abstract = {Microcin B17 is a 3.1-kDa bactericidal peptide; the putative target of this antibiotic is DNA gyrase. Microcin B17 has no detectable effect on gyrase-catalysed DNA supercoiling or relaxation activities in vitro and is unable to stabilise DNA cleavage in the absence of nucleotides. However, in the presence of ATP, or the non-hydrolysable analogue 5'-adenylyl beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate, microcin B17 stabilises a gyrase-dependent DNA cleavage complex in a manner reminiscent of quinolones, Ca(2+), or the bacterial toxin CcdB. The pattern of DNA cleavage produced by gyrase in the presence of microcin B17 is different from that produced by quinolones and more closely resembles Ca(2+)-mediated cleavage. Several gyrase mutants, including well-known quinolone-resistant mutants, are cross resistant to microcin-induced DNA cleavage. We suggest that microcin exerts its effects through a mechanism that has similarities to those of both the bacterial toxin CcdB and the quinolone antibacterial agents.},

abstract = {Modern medicine is built on antibiotics. Antibiotics are something that we take for granted. We have however spent over 60 years educating bacteria to become resistant, and the global resistance tsunami has caught everyone unawares. Since bacteria have changed, we also have to change, and to change most of the practices of how we use antibiotics. Because the development of new antibiotics is so expensive, a stewardship approach may help to preserve those that we have now while we work to develop new antibiotics and to develop other approaches to controlling and treating infections. We need to adopt the ethic of Good Stewardship Practice (GSP) as an active and dynamic process of continuous improvement in antibiotic use, a process with many steps of different sizes involving everyone involved in antibiotic use. All antibiotic users have an important role to play in GSP. Although the resistance situation is pessimistic, and the future of antibiotics looks uncertain, we are fortunately entering what may be seen as the golden age of microbiology. This encompasses an astonishing array of technologies for rapid pathogen and resistance gene detection, for clone identification by genome sequencing, for identification of novel bacterial genes and for identification of the Achilles' heels of different pathogens. Future antibiotics may have to be far more targeted to the individual pathogen and the site of infection. A global tax on antibiotics might reduce their use while funding the cost of developing new antibiotics and new approaches to control of infectious diseases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of extended-spectrum cephalosporinase (ESC)-producing Escherichia coli in pigs at slaughter and retail meat, and possible associations with the consumption of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. METHODS: During 2009, faecal samples from Danish pigs (n=786) were collected at slaughter, and 866 meat samples [Danish: pork (153), broiler meat (121) and beef (142); and imported: pork (173), broiler meat (193) and beef (84)] were randomly collected in retail stores and outlets. E. coli was isolated after enrichment in MacConkey broth with ceftriaxone (1 mg/L). ESC genotypes were detected using PCR, microtube array and sequencing. The MIC of cefotaxime was determined for 150 E. coli from the pigs and 606 E. coli from meat isolated without selective enrichment. RESULTS: Eleven percent (86/786) of slaughter pigs contained ESC E. coli and a significantly higher prevalence was observed among pigs originating from farms with registered cephalosporin consumption in slaughter pigs (P=0.034). Among ESC E. coli from pigs, 66{\%} contained bla(CTX-M-1). From meat, a high prevalence of ESC E. coli was found in imported broiler meat (36{\%}) compared with 0.7{\%}-3.3{\%} in other meat types. ESC E. coli from imported broiler meat (n=69) contained bla(CMY-2) (48{\%}), bla(CTX-M-1) (25{\%}) and bla(SHV-12) (16{\%}). Without selective enrichment, no ESC E. coli from pigs and only 4.1{\%} from imported broiler meat were found. CONCLUSIONS: The usage of cephalosporins for slaughter pigs may increase the prevalence of ESC E. coli in slaughter pigs. Meat may be a source of ESCs in humans, especially imported broiler meat. Selective enrichment should be considered as a supplementary surveillance method.},

All of the pacemakers were implanted for complete AV block or sick sinus syndrome. The pacemakers were randomly programmed into VVI or rate responsive (VVIR) pacing modes for 3-week study periods in each mode. At the end of each period, an exercise test was performed and the QOL was evaluated by the "Hacettepe Quality-of-Life Questionnaire". All patients exercised longer in the VVIR mode (mean 10.54 +/- 0.73 min) than in the VVI mode (mean 7.81 +/- 0.62 min) (P less than 0.05). QOL scores were also found to be significantly higher in the VVIR mode (mean 173.81 +/- 16.22 points) compared to the VVI mode (mean 156.27 +/- 21.22 points) (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, our results suggest that VVIR pacing offers a better QOL in addition to an improved exercise capacity, compared to the single chamber nonrate modulated pacing (VVI).},

@article{Hooper2015,
abstract = {Quinolone antimicrobials are synthetic and widely used in clinical medicine. Resistance emerged with clinical use and became common in some bacterial pathogens. Mechanisms of resistance include two categories of mutation and acquisition of resistance-conferring genes. Resistance mutations in one or both of the two drug target enzymes, DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV, are commonly in a localized domain of the GyrA and ParE subunits of the respective enzymes and reduce drug binding to the enzyme-DNA complex. Other resistance mutations occur in regulatory genes that control the expression of native efflux pumps localized in the bacterial membrane(s). These pumps have broad substrate profiles that include quinolones as well as other antimicrobials, disinfectants, and dyes. Mutations of both types can accumulate with selection pressure and produce highly resistant strains. Resistance genes acquired on plasmids can confer low-level resistance that promotes the selection of mutational high-level resistance. Plasmid-encoded resistance is due to Qnr proteins that protect the target enzymes from quinolone action, one mutant aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme that also modifies certain quinolones, and mobile efflux pumps. Plasmids with these mechanisms often encode additional antimicrobial resistances and can transfer multidrug resistance that includes quinolones. Thus, the bacterial quinolone resistance armamentarium is large.},

abstract = {A temporal trend analysis was performed on antimicrobial resistance data collected over 4 consecutive years (2011-2014) in the official Belgian antimicrobial resistance monitoring programme. Commensal Escherichia coli strains were isolated from faecal samples of four livestock categories (veal calves, young beef cattle, broiler chickens and slaughter pigs) and the trends of resistance profiles were analysed. The resistance prevalence remained high ({\textgreater}50{\%}) during the study period for ampicillin in veal calves and chickens, for ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid in chickens, for sulfamethoxazole in veal calves, chickens and pigs and for tetracycline in veal calves. Using logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equation and after p value adjustment for multiple testing (Linear step-up method), statistically significant decreasing temporal trends were observed for several of the 11 tested antimicrobials in several livestock categories: in veal calves (10/11), in chickens (6/11) and in pigs (5/11). A significant increasing trend was observed for the prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin in chickens. Multi-resistance, considered as the resistance to at least three antimicrobials of different antibiotic classes, was observed in the four livestock categories but was significantly decreasing in veal calves, chickens and pigs. Overall, the prevalence of resistance and of multi-resistance was lowest in the beef cattle livestock category and highest in broiler chickens. These decreasing temporal trends of antimicrobial resistance might be due to a decrease of the total antimicrobial consumption for veterinary use in Belgium which was reported for the period between 2010 and 2013. The methodology and statistical tools developed in this study provide outputs which can detect shifts in resistance levels or resistance trends associated with particular antimicrobial classes and livestock categories. Such outputs can be used as objective evidence to evaluate the possible efficacy of measures taken by animal health authorities and stakeholders in the livestock sector to limit antimicrobial resistance occurrence.},

The odontogenic cells were found to originate from the stem cells which by autoradiography were shown to be slow cycling and lightly labelled. As they differentiated they became heavily labelled and were designated transit 'dividing cells'. With further differentiation the cells were unlabelled and were designated 'simple transit cells'. It was concluded from the present study that outer enamel epithelium functioned as the source of all odontogenic epithelium; that primitive mesenchyme around the cervical loop functioned as the source of all odontogenic mesenchyme and that all of the transit cells which differentiated to become functional migrated coronally.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: In Sweden the prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae with transferable resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) is low. However, in broilers ESC-resistant Escherichia coli is common, with a clear dominance of blaCMY-2. Antimicrobials are rarely used in broiler production in Sweden and cephalosporins are never used. Introduction through imported breeding stock and subsequent vertical transmission of the bacteria through the production pyramid could be one explanation for this high prevalence. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, paper linings from imported flocks of grandparent animals were screened for the presence of ESC-resistant E. coli and a positive flock, together with its progeny, was followed longitudinally through the production pyramid using boot swabs. The relationship of isolated ESC-resistant E. coli was investigated using multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). RESULTS: ESC-resistant E. coli carrying blaCMY-2 was isolated from six out of eight imported flocks of grandparent animals. One clone of E. coli carrying blaCMY-2 occurred in all levels of the production pyramid and in flocks of imported grandparent animals. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli carrying blaCMY-2 is frequently present among grandparent animals imported to Sweden for breeding purposes. The occurrence of one clone in all levels of the production pyramid indicates that its introduction through imported breeding stock and vertical transmission through the production pyramid could be one explanation for the high proportion of Swedish broilers colonized with ESC-resistant E. coli.},

abstract = {Enterobacteriaceae resistant to quinolones frequently arise in animals, being easily disseminated through the food-chain. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants in Salmonella spp. ( n= 183) and Escherichia coli ( n= 180) isolates, collected from food-producing animals and food products among swine, poultry, rabbits and cattle. All isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular screening of PMQR determinants. ??-Lactamase-encoding genes, and the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes were also investigated in PMQR-positive isolates. Plasmid characterization was performed by conjugation, followed by replicon-typing. Genetic relatedness of PMQR-positive E. coli was examined by Multilocus Sequence Typing, while Salmonella was previously serotyped. The association of mobile genetic elements and PMQR was investigated through PCR mapping assays. Overall, 4.1{\%} (15/363) isolates harbored qnrB2 ( n= 3), qnrB19 ( n= 3), and qnrS1 ( n= 9) genes. All but one isolate presented one to four mutations in QRDR of gyrA or parC genes, which is consistent with the range of MIC values detected (0.19-64. mg/L) for ciprofloxacin; 60{\%} (9/15) of qnr-harboring isolates were non-susceptible to ??-lactam antibiotics which was justified by the presence of ??-lactamases from TEM (TEM-1, n= 8; TEM-135, n= 1) and SHV (SHV-108, n= 1) families. Analysis of mobile genetic elements revealed that qnr genes were detected nearby relevant genetic elements like intI1, ISEcl2, IS26 and ISCR1 and enclosed in diverse Inc. type plasmids. This study illustrated the existence of Qnr-producing E. coli and Salmonella from food-producing animals, associated to specific mobile elements that might mediate their transference between species and among distinct settings. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Fluoroquinolone use in poultry production may select for resistant Escherichia coli that can be transmitted to humans. To define the prevalence and virulence potential of poultry-associated, quinolone-resistant E. coli in the United States, 169 retail chicken products from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area (1999 to 2000) were screened for nalidixic acid (Nal)-resistant E. coli. Sixty-two (37{\%}) products yielded Nal-resistant E. coli. From 55 products that yielded both Nal-resistant and susceptible E. coli, two isolates (one resistant, one susceptible) per sample were further characterized. Twenty-three (21{\%}) of the 110 E. coli isolates (13 resistant, 10 susceptible) satisfied criteria for extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), i.e., exhibited {\textgreater}or=2 of pap (P fimbriae), sfa/foc (S/F1C fimbriae), afa/dra (Dr binding adhesins), iutA (aerobactin receptor), and kpsMT II (group 2 capsule synthesis). Compared with other isolates, ExPEC isolates more often derived from virulence-associated E. coli phylogenetic groups B2 or D (74{\%} versus 32{\%}; P {\textless} 0.001) and exhibited more ExPEC-associated virulence markers (median, 10.0 versus 4.0; P {\textless} 0.001). In contrast, the Nal-resistant and -susceptible populations were indistinguishable according to all characteristics analyzed, including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles. These findings indicate that Nal-resistant E. coli is prevalent in retail poultry products and that a substantial minority of such strains represent potential human pathogens. The similarity of the Nal-resistant and -susceptible populations suggests that they derive from the same source population, presumably the avian fecal flora, with Nal resistance emerging by spontaneous mutation as a result of fluoroquinolone exposure.},

abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer is a principal source of evolution leading to change in the ecological character of bacterial species. Bacterial conjugation, which promotes the horizontal transfer of genetic material between donor and recipient cells by physical contact, is a phenomenon of fundamental evolutionary consequence. Although conjugation has been studied primarily in liquid, most natural bacterial populations are found associated with environmental surfaces in complex multispecies communities called biofilms. Biofilms are ideally suited to the exchange of genetic material of various origins, and it has been shown that bacterial conjugation occurs within biofilms. Here I investigate the direct contribution of conjugative plasmids themselves to the capacity of the bacterial host to form a biofilm. Natural conjugative plasmids expressed factors that induced planktonic bacteria to form or enter biofilm communities, which favour the infectious transfer of the plasmid. This general connection between conjugation and biofilms suggests that medically relevant plasmid-bearing strains are more likely to form a biofilm. This may influence both the chances of biofilm-related infection risks and of conjugational spread of virulence factors.},

Natural products that are inhibitors of one or both of these topoisomerases include the coumarin and cyclothialidine classes, which interfere with adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis, cinodine, flavones, and terpenoid derivatives. The plasmid-encoded bacterial peptides micron B17 and CcdB also inhibit DNA gyrase. The quinolones, a synthetic class of antibacterials that act on both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV have had the broadest clinical applications, however. Quinolone congeners differ in their relative potencies for DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV Studies of an expanding set of resistant mutant enzymes and the crystal structure of the homologous enzyme in yeast have contributed to our understanding of interactions of these drugs with topoisomerase-DNA complexes and the ways in which mutations effect resistance.},

abstract = {Although biofilms represent a common bacterial lifestyle in clinically and environmentally important habitats, there is scant information on the extent of gene transfer in these spatially structured populations. The objective of this study was to gain insight into factors that affect transfer of the promiscuous multidrug resistance plasmid pB10 in Escherichia coli biofilms. Biofilms were grown in different experimental settings, and plasmid transfer was monitored using laser scanning confocal microscopy and plate counting. In closed flow cells, plasmid transfer in surface-attached submerged biofilms was negligible. In contrast, a high plasmid transfer efficiency was observed in a biofilm floating at the air-liquid interface in an open flow cell with low flow rates. A vertical flow cell and a batch culture biofilm reactor were then used to detect plasmid transfer at different depths away from the air-liquid interface. Extensive plasmid transfer occurred only in a narrow zone near that interface. The much lower transfer frequencies in the lower zones coincided with rapidly decreasing oxygen concentrations. However, when an E. coli csrA mutant was used as the recipient, a thick biofilm was obtained at all depths, and plasmid transfer occurred at similar frequencies throughout. These results and data from separate aerobic and anaerobic matings suggest that oxygen can affect IncP-1 plasmid transfer efficiency, not only directly but also indirectly, through influencing population densities and therefore colocalization of donors and recipients. In conclusion, the air-liquid interface can be a hot spot for plasmid-mediated gene transfer due to high densities of juxtaposed donor and recipient cells.},

abstract = {Pathogenic Escherichia coli strains cause a wide variety of intestinal and extraintestinal infections. The widespread geographical clonal dissemination of intestinal pathogenic E. coli strains, such as E. coli O157:H7, is well recognized, and its spread is most often attributed to contaminated food products. On the other hand, the clonal dissemination of extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains is also recognized, but the mechanism of their spread is not well explained. Here, I describe major pandemic clonal lineages of ExPEC based on multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and discuss possible reasons for their global dissemination. These lineages include sequence type (ST)131, ST393, ST69, ST95, and ST73, which are all associated with both community-onset and healthcare-associated infections, in particular urinary tract infections and bloodstream infections. As with many other types of drug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial infections, drug-resistant ExPEC infections are recognized to be caused by a limited set of clonal lineages. However, reported observations on these major pandemic lineages suggest that the resistance phenotype is not necessarily the determinant of their clonal dissemination. Both epidemiological factors and their intrinsic biological 'fitness' are likely to contribute. An important public health and clinical concern is that pandemicity itself may be a determinant of progressive drug resistance acquisition by clonal lineages. New research is urgently needed to better understand the epidemiological and biological causes of ExPEC pandemicity. ? 2014 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.},

abstract = {The objectives of this study were to determine rates, patterns, and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and to assess connections between chicken commensal, human commensal, and pathogenic ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli isolates. All E. coli isolates collected from chickens, their farmers, and patients in the Constantine region (North-east Algeria) were analyzed for bla and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) gene contents, phylogroups, Rep-PCR profiles, and multilocus sequence types. A high prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones (51.4 {\%} to ciprofloxacin) was recorded in avian isolates. Of these, 22.2 {\%} carried the aac(6')-Ib-cr gene, whereas lower resistance levels to these antibiotics were recorded in chicken farmers' isolates. None of the commensal isolates harbored the qnr, qepA, or oqxAB genes. One human pathogenic isolate was ertapenem-resistant and harbored the blaOXA-48 gene, 84 showed an extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase phenotype, with blaCTX-M-15 gene prevalent in 87.2 {\%} of them. Seventy isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones, with aac(6')-Ib-cr present in 72.8 {\%}, qnrB in 5.7 {\%}, and qnrS in 10 {\%}. Three Rep-PCR profiles were common to chicken commensal and human pathogenic isolates (phylogroups D and B1; ST21, ST48, and ST471 respectively); one was found in both chicken and chicken-farmer commensal strains (D; ST108), while another profile was identified in a chicken-farmer commensal strain and a human pathogenic one (B1; ST19). These findings suggest clonal and epidemiologic links between chicken and human ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli isolates and the important role that poultry may play in the epidemiology of human E. coli infections in the Constantine region.},

abstract = {For many decades, Salmonella enterica has been subdivided by serological properties into serovars or further subdivided for epidemiological tracing by a variety of diagnostic tests with higher resolution. Recently, it has been proposed that so-called eBurst groups (eBGs) based on the alleles of seven housekeeping genes (legacy multilocus sequence typing [MLST]) corresponded to natural populations and could replace serotyping. However, this approach lacks the resolution needed for epidemiological tracing and the existence of natural populations had not been independently validated by independent criteria. Here, we describe EnteroBase, a web-based platform that assembles draft genomes from Illumina short reads in the public domain or that are uploaded by users. EnteroBase implements legacy MLST as well as ribosomal gene MLST (rMLST), core genome MLST (cgMLST), and whole genome MLST (wgMLST) and currently contains over 100,000 assembled genomes from Salmonella. It also provides graphical tools for visual interrogation of these genotypes and those based on core single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). eBGs based on legacy MLST are largely consistent with eBGs based on rMLST, thus demonstrating that these correspond to natural populations. rMLST also facilitated the selection of representative genotypes for SNP analyses of the entire breadth of diversity within Salmonella. In contrast, cgMLST provides the resolution needed for epidemiological investigations. These observations show that genomic genotyping, with the assistance of EnteroBase, can be applied at all levels of diversity within the Salmonella genus.},

abstract = {For Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, 85{\%} of isolates can be classified into 5 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types. However, PFGE has limited discriminatory power for outbreak detection. Although whole-genome sequencing has been found to improve discrimination of outbreak clusters, whether this procedure can be used in real-time in a public health laboratory is not known. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective and prospective analysis. The retrospective study investigated isolates from 1 confirmed outbreak. Additional cases could be attributed to the outbreak strain on the basis of whole-genome data. The prospective study included 58 isolates obtained in 2012, including isolates from 1 epidemiologically defined outbreak. Whole-genome sequencing identified additional isolates that could be attributed to the outbreak, but which differed from the outbreak-associated PFGE type. Additional putative outbreak clusters were detected in the retrospective and prospective analyses. This study demonstrates the practicality of implementing this approach for outbreak surveillance in a state public health laboratory.},

abstract = {Mobile genetic elements have a crucial role in spreading antibiotic resistance genes among bacterial populations. Environmental and genetic factors that regulate conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial populations are largely unknown. Integrating conjugative elements (ICEs) are a diverse group of mobile elements that are transferred by means of cell-cell contact and integrate into the chromosome of the new host. SXT is a approximately 100-kilobase ICE derived from Vibrio cholerae that encodes genes that confer resistance to chloramphenicol, sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim and streptomycin. SXT-related elements were not detected in V. cholerae before 1993 but are now present in almost all clinical V. cholerae isolates from Asia. ICEs related to SXT are also present in several other bacterial species and encode a variety of antibiotic and heavy metal resistance genes. Here we show that SetR, an SXT encoded repressor, represses the expression of activators of SXT transfer. The 'SOS response' to DNA damage alleviates this repression, increasing the expression of genes necessary for SXT transfer and hence the frequency of transfer. SOS is induced by a variety of environmental factors and antibiotics, for example ciprofloxacin, and we show that ciprofloxacin induces SXT transfer as well. Thus, we present a mechanism by which therapeutic agents can promote the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.},

@article{Koonin2016,
abstract = {The wide spread of gene exchange and loss in the prokaryotic world has prompted the concept of 'lateral genomics' to the point of an outright denial of the relevance of phylogenetic trees for evolution. However, the pronounced coherence congruence of the topologies of numerous gene trees, particularly those for (nearly) universal genes, translates into the notion of a statistical tree of life (STOL), which reflects a central trend of vertical evolution. The STOL can be employed as a framework for reconstruction of the evolutionary processes in the prokaryotic world. Quantitatively, however, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) dominates microbial evolution, with the rate of gene gain and loss being comparable to the rate of point mutations and much greater than the duplication rate. Theoretical models of evolution suggest that HGT is essential for the survival of microbial populations that otherwise deteriorate due to the Muller's ratchet effect. Apparently, at least some bacteria and archaea evolved dedicated vehicles for gene transfer that evolved from selfish elements such as plasmids and viruses. Recent phylogenomic analyses suggest that episodes of massive HGT were pivotal for the emergence of major groups of organisms such as multiple archaeal phyla as well as eukaryotes. Similar analyses appear to indicate that, in addition to donating hundreds of genes to the emerging eukaryotic lineage, mitochondrial endosymbiosis severely curtailed HGT. These results shed new light on the routes of evolutionary transitions, but caution is due given the inherent uncertainty of deep phylogenies.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) is a worldwide pandemic clone, causing predominantly community-onset antimicrobial-resistant infection. Its pandemic spread was identified in 2008 by utilizing multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli from three continents. Subsequent research has confirmed the worldwide prevalence of ST131 harbouring a broad range of virulence and resistance genes on a transferable plasmid. A high prevalence of the clone ( approximately 30{\%}-60{\%}) has been identified amongst fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli. In addition, it potentially harbours a variety of beta-lactamase genes; most often, these include CTX-M family beta-lactamases, and, less frequently, TEM, SHV and CMY beta-lactamases. Our knowledge of ST131's geographical distribution is incomplete. A broad distribution has been demonstrated amongst antimicrobial-resistant E. coli from human infection in Europe (particularly the UK), North America, Canada, Japan and Korea. High rates are suggested from limited data in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The clone has also been detected in companion animals, non-companion animals and foods. The clinical spectrum of disease described is similar to that for other E. coli, with urinary tract infection predominant. This can range from cystitis to life-threatening sepsis. Infection occurs in humans of all ages. Therapy must be tailored to the antimicrobial resistance phenotype of the infecting isolate and the site of infection. Phenotypic detection of the ST131 clone is not possible and DNA-based techniques, including MLST and PCR, are described.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to: estimate the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli carriage among broiler farmers, their family members and employees; identify and quantify risk factors for carriage, with an emphasis on contact with live broilers; and compare isolates from humans and broilers within farms with respect to molecular characteristics to gain insight into transmission routes. METHODS: A cross-sectional prevalence study was conducted on 50 randomly selected Dutch broiler farms. Cloacal swabs were taken from 20 randomly chosen broilers. Faecal swabs were returned by 141 individuals living and/or working on 47 farms. ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli were isolated and, for selected isolates, phylogenetic groups, plasmids and sequence types were determined. Questionnaires were used for risk factor analysis. RESULTS: All sampled farms were positive, with 96.4{\%} positive pooled broiler samples. The human prevalence was 19.1{\%}, with 14.3{\%} and 27.1{\%} among individuals having a low and a high degree of contact with live broilers, respectively. Five pairs of human-broiler isolates had identical genes, plasmid families and E. coli sequence types, showing clonal transmission. Furthermore, similar ESBL/AmpC genes on the same plasmid families in different E. coli sequence types in humans and broilers hinted at horizontal gene transfer. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence among people on broiler farms was higher than in previous studies involving patients and the general population. Furthermore, an increased risk of carriage was shown among individuals having a high degree of contact with live broilers. The (relative) contribution of transmission routes that might play a role in the dissemination of ESBL/AmpC-encoding resistance genes to humans on broiler farms should be pursued in future studies.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and genetic relatedness of antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli from healthy pigs and broiler chicken, pork, broiler meat, slaughterhouse personnel and outpatients in Iceland. A total of 419 E. coli isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using a microbroth dilution method (VetMIC), and resistant strains were compared using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). All samples were screened for enrofloxacin-resistant strains with selective agar plates. The resistance rates among E. coli isolates were moderate to high from caecal and meat samples of pigs (54.1{\%} and 28{\%}), broilers (33.6{\%} and 52{\%}) and slaughterhouse personnel (39.1{\%}), whereas isolates from outpatients showed moderate resistance rates (23.1{\%}). Of notice was resistance to quinolones (minimum inhibitory concentrations: nalidixic acid {\textgreater} or = 32, ciprofloxacin {\textgreater} or = 0.12 and enrofloxacin {\textgreater} or = 0.5), particularly among broiler and broiler meat isolates (18.2{\%} and 36{\%}), as there is no known antimicrobial selection pressure in the broiler production in Iceland. The majority (78.6{\%}) of the resistant E. coli isolates was genotypically different, based on PFGE fingerprint analyses and clustering was limited. However, the same resistance pattern and pulsotype were found among isolates from broiler meat and a slaughterhouse worker, indicating spread of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli from animals to humans. Diverse resistance patterns and pulsotypes suggest the presence of a large population of resistant E. coli in production animals in Iceland. This study gives baseline information on the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli from production animals, and their food products in Iceland and the moderate to high resistance rates emphasize the need for continuing surveillance. Further studies on the origin of the resistant strains and the genetic relatedness of strains of different origin are needed.},

We analyzed the within-sample prevalence of QREC in individual fecal samples from preweaned dairy calves and postpartum cows and in environmental samples from 23 Swedish dairy farms. The genetic diversity of the QREC isolates on 10 of these farms was assessed. In general, QREC was more prevalent in the dairy farm environment and in postpartum cows if QREC was commonly found in calves than if QREC was rare in calves. In particular, we found more QREC organisms in feed and water troughs and in environments that may come into contact with young calves. Thus, the results suggest that QREC circulates between cattle and the farm environment and that calves are important for the maintenance of QREC. Some genotypes of QREC were widespread both within and between farms, indicating that QREC has spread within the farms and likely also between farms, possibly through purchased animals. Farms that had purchased many animals over the years had greater within-farm diversity than farms with more closed animal populations. Finally, animals on more closely located farms were more likely to share the same genotype than animals on farms located far apart.},

abstract = {The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistances is now a worldwide problem. Investigating the mechanisms by which pets harboring resistant strains may receive and/or transfer resistance determinants is essential to better understanding how owners and pets can interact safely. Here, we characterized the genetic determinants conferring resistance to $\beta$-lactams and quinolones in 38 multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli isolated from fecal samples of dogs, through PCR and sequencing. The most frequent genotype included the $\beta$-lactamase groups TEM (n=5), and both TEM + CTX-M-1 (n=5). Within the CTX-M group, we identified the genes CTX-M-32, CTX-M-1, CTX-M-15, CTX-M-55/79, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-2/44. Thirty isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin presented two mutations in the gyrA gene and one or two mutations in the parC gene. A mutation in gyrA (reported here for the first time), due to a transversion and transition (TCG. â. GTG) originating a substitution of a serine by a valine in position 83 was also detected. The plasmid-encoded quinolone resistance gene, qnrs1, was detected in three isolates. Dogs can be a reservoir of genetic determinants conferring antimicrobial resistance and thus may play an important role in the spread of antimicrobial resistance to humans and other co-habitant animals.},

A selection of isolates (n=313) were also analysed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Isolates harbouring bla(CTX-M-group-1) dominated (66{\%}, n=418) and originated from both animals and cases of human infections in all three countries; 23{\%} (n=144) of all isolates contained both bla(CTX-M-group-1) and bla(OXA-1-like) genes, predominantly from humans (n=127) and UK cattle (n=15). The antimicrobial resistance and virulence gene profiles of this collection of isolates were highly diverse. A substantial number of human isolates (32{\%}, n=87) did not share more than 40{\%} similarity (based on the Jaccard coefficient) with animal isolates. A further 43{\%} of human isolates from the three countries (n=117) were at least 40{\%} similar to each other and to five isolates from UK cattle and one each from Dutch chicken meat and a German dog; the members of this group usually harboured genes such as mph(A), mrx, aac(6')-Ib, catB3, bla(OXA-1-like) and bla(CTX-M-group-1). forty-four per cent of the MLST-typed isolates in this group belonged to ST131 (n=18) and 22{\%} to ST405 (n=9), all from humans. Among animal isolates subjected to MLST (n=258), only 1.2{\%} (n=3) were more than 70{\%} similar to human isolates in gene profiles and shared the same MLST clonal complex with the corresponding human isolates. The results suggest that minimising human-to-human transmission is essential to control the spread of ESBL-positive E. coli in humans.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to gain knowledge of the local epidemiology of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant bacteria in primary care patients in a Swiss community. Fecal swabs were obtained from 291 primary care patients. Phenotyping and genotyping methods were used for further characterization of the isolates. Risk factors associated with carriage of ss-lactam-resistant strains were determined. Extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 15 (5.2{\%}) of the primary care patients. Thirteen isolates were CTX-M producers, one produced SHV-12, and three carried CMY-2. The pathogenic pandemic clone Escherichia coli ST131 was detected in 26.6{\%} of the patients. Two patients (13.3{\%}) carried two distinct strains simultaneously. There was a statistically significant risk of carriage of resistant strains for persons with a history of antibiotic therapy 4 months before sampling (p=0.05), markedly for therapy with ss-lactam (p=0.01). Age, gender, or history of hospitalization 4 months before sampling was not a risk factor for the acquisition of resistant bacteria in the analyzed patients. The relatively low prevalence of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant strains in the community reflects the nationwide restrictive policy of antibiotic prescription as well as local implementation thereof. Nevertheless, our study shows that a potent antimicrobial resistance reservoir is present in primary care patients.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli is the most common cause of urinary tract infection (UTI). Phylogroup B2 and D isolates are associated with UTI. It has been proposed that E. coli causing UTI could have an animal origin. The objective of this study was to investigate the phylogroups and antimicrobial resistance, and their possible associations in E. coli isolates from patients with UTI, community-dwelling humans, broiler chicken meat, broiler chickens, pork, and pigs in Denmark. A total of 964 geographically and temporally matched E. coli isolates from UTI patients (n = 102), community-dwelling humans (n = 109), Danish (n = 197) and imported broiler chicken meat (n = 86), Danish broiler chickens (n = 138), Danish (n = 177) and imported pork (n = 10), and Danish pigs (n = 145) were tested for phylogroups (A, B1, B2, D, and nontypeable [NT] isolates) and antimicrobial susceptibility. Phylogroup A, B1, B2, D, and NT isolates were detected among all groups of isolates except for imported pork isolates. Antimicrobial resistance to three (for B2 isolates) or five antimicrobial agents (for A, B1, D, and NT isolates) was shared among isolates regardless of origin. Using cluster analysis to investigate antimicrobial resistance data, we found that UTI isolates always grouped with isolates from meat and/or animals. We detected B2 and D isolates, that are associated to UTI, among isolates from broiler chicken meat, broiler chickens, pork, and pigs. Although B2 isolates were found in low prevalences in animals and meat, these sources could still pose a risk for acquiring uropathogenic E. coli. Further, E. coli from animals and meat were very similar to UTI isolates with respect to their antimicrobial resistance phenotype. Thus, our study provides support for the hypothesis that a food animal and meat reservoir might exist for UTI-causing E. coli.},

A semiquantitative theoretical analysis of the steady-state composition of an Escherichia coli population suggests that true strong genotypic mutators produce about 3 x 10(-3) of the single mutations arising in the population, while transient mutators produce at least 10{\%} of the single mutations and more than 95{\%} of the simultaneous double mutations. Numbers of mismatch repair proteins inherited by the offspring, proportions of lethal mutations and mortality rates are among the main parameters that influence the steady-state composition of the population. These results have implications for the experimental manipulation of mutation rates and the evolutionary fixation of frequent but nearly neutral mutations (e.g., synonymous codon substitutions).},

abstract = {Biofilms have been of considerable interest in the context of food hygiene. Of special significance is the ability of microorganisms to attach and grow on food and food-contact surfaces under favourable conditions. Biofilm formation is a dynamic process and different mechanisms are involved in their attachment and growth. Extracellular polymeric substances play an important role in the attachment and colonization of microorganisms to food-contact surfaces. Various techniques have been adopted for the proper study and understanding of biofilm attachment and control. If the microorganisms from food-contact surfaces are not completely removed, they may lead to biofilm formation and also increase the biotransfer potential. Therefore, various preventive and control strategies like hygienic plant lay-out and design of equipment, choice of materials, correct use and selection of detergents and disinfectants coupled with physical methods can be suitably applied for controlling biofilm formation on food-contact surfaces. In addition, bacteriocins and enzymes are gaining importance and have an unique potential in the food industry for the effective biocontrol and removal of biofilms. These newer biocontrol strategies are considered important for the maintenance of biofilm-free systems, for quality and safety of foods.},

abstract = {Fluoroquinolones are antibacterial drugs that inhibit DNA Gyrase and Topoisomerase IV. These essential enzymes facilitate chromosome replication and RNA transcription by regulating chromosome supercoiling. High-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in E. coli requires the accumulation of multiple mutations, including those that alter target genes and genes regulating drug efflux. Previous studies have shown some drug-resistance mutations reduce bacterial fitness, leading to the selection of fitness-compensatory mutations. The impact of fluoroquinolone-resistance on bacterial fitness was analyzed in constructed isogenic strains carrying up to 5 resistance mutations. Some mutations significantly decreased bacterial fitness both in vitro and in vivo. We identified low-fitness triple-mutants where the acquisition of a fourth resistance mutation significantly increased fitness in vitro and in vivo while at the same time dramatically decreasing drug susceptibility. The largest effect occurred with the addition of a parC mutation (Topoisomerase IV) to a low-fitness strain carrying resistance mutations in gyrA (DNA Gyrase) and marR (drug efflux regulation). Increased fitness was accompanied by a significant change in the level of gyrA promoter activity as measured in an assay of DNA supercoiling. In selection and competition experiments made in the absence of drug, parC mutants that improved fitness and reduced susceptibility were selected. These data suggest that natural selection for improved growth in bacteria with low-level resistance to fluoroquinolones could in some cases select for further reductions in drug susceptibility. Thus, increased resistance to fluoroquinolones could be selected even in the absence of further exposure to the drug.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cronobacter spp. are opportunistic pathogens that can cause septicemia and infections of the central nervous system primarily in premature, low-birth weight and/or immune-compromised neonates. Serum resistance is a crucial virulence factor for the development of systemic infections, including bacteremia. It was the aim of the current study to identify genes involved in serum tolerance in a selected Cronobacter sakazakii strain of clinical origin. RESULTS: Screening of 2749 random transposon knock out mutants of a C. sakazakii ES 5 library for modified serum tolerance (compared to wild type) revealed 10 mutants showing significantly increased/reduced resistance to serum killing. Identification of the affected sites in mutants displaying reduced serum resistance revealed genes encoding for surface and membrane proteins as well as regulatory elements or chaperones. By this approach, the involvement of the yet undescribed Wzy{\_}C superfamily domain containing coding region in serum tolerance was observed and experimentally confirmed. Additionally, knock out mutants with enhanced serum tolerance were observed. Examination of respective transposon insertion loci revealed regulatory (repressor) elements, coding regions for chaperones and efflux systems as well as the coding region for the protein YbaJ. Real time expression analysis experiments revealed, that knock out of the gene for this protein negatively affects the expression of the fimA gene, which is a key structural component of the formation of fimbriae. Fimbriae are structures of high immunogenic potential and it is likely that absence/truncation of the ybaJ gene resulted in a non-fimbriated phenotype accounting for the enhanced survival of this mutant in human serum. CONCLUSION: By using a transposon knock out approach we were able to identify genes involved in both increased and reduced serum tolerance in Cronobacter sakazakii ES5. This study reveals first insights in the complex nature of serum tolerance of Cronobacter spp.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance of E. coli, to modern beta-lactam antibiotics due to the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and/or plasmid-mediated AmpC-beta-lactamases (AmpC) represent an emerging and increasing resistance problem dramatically limiting therapeutic options in both human and veterinary medicine. The presence of ESBL/AmpC-genes in commensal E. coli from food-producing animals like broilers may pose a human health hazard. However, there are no data available concerning the prevalence of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in German broiler flocks using selective methods. In this longitudinal study, samples were taken from seven conventional broiler fattening farms at three different times within one fattening period. Various samples originating from the animals as well as from their direct environment in the barn were investigated for the occurrence of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli.Average detection levels of 51 {\%}, 75 {\%} and 76 {\%} in animal samples collected during the three samplings in the course of the fattening period demonstrate a colonization of even one-day-old chicks as well as a continuous significant (p{\textless}0.001) increase in prevalence thereafter. The detection frequencies in housing environmental samples were relatively high with an increase over time and ranged between 54.2 {\%} and 100 {\%}. A total of 359 E. coli isolates were characterized by PCR and partly via the disc diffusion method. This study shows that prevalence of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli increases during the fattening period of broiler flocks examined. Both colonized day old chicks and contaminated farm environment could represent significant sources introducing ESBL/AmpC- producing E. coli in German broiler fattening farms.},

Common bacterial pathogens in the community such as Streptococcus pneumoniae have become progressively more resistant to traditional antibiotics. Salmonella strains are beginning to show resistance to crucial fluoroquinolone drugs. Community outbreaks caused by a resistant form of Staphylococcus aureus, known as community-associated meticillin (formerly methicillin)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, have caused serious morbidity and even deaths in previously healthy children and adults. To decrease the spread of such antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in the community, a greater understanding of their means of emergence and survival is needed.},

abstract = {AbstractExposure to antibiotics induces the expression of mutagenic bacterial stressâresponse pathways, but the evolutionary benefits of these responses remain unclear. One possibility is that stressâresponse pathways provide a short-term advantage by protecting bacteria against the toxic effects of antibiotics. Second, it is possible that stress-induced mutagenesis provides a long-term advantage by accelerating the evolution of resistance. Here, we directly measure the contribution of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa SOS pathway to bacterial fitness and evolvability in the presence of sublethal doses of ciprofloxacin. Using short-term competition experiments, we demonstrate that the SOS pathway increases competitive fitness in the presence of ciprofloxacin. Continued exposure to ciprofloxacin results in the rapid evolution of increased fitness and antibiotic resistance, but we find no evidence that SOS-induced mutagenesis accelerates the rate of adaptation to ciprofloxacin during a 200 generation selection experiment. Intriguingly, we find that the expression of the SOS pathway decreases during adaptation to ciprofloxacin, and this helps to explain why this pathway does not increase long-term evolvability. Furthermore, we argue that the SOS pathway fails to accelerate adaptation to ciprofloxacin because the modest increase in the mutation rate associated with SOS mutagenesis is offset by a decrease in the effective strength of selection for increased resistance at a population level. Our findings suggest that the primary evolutionary benefit of the SOS response is to increase bacterial competitive ability, and that stress-induced mutagenesis is an unwanted side effect, and not a selected attribute, of this pathway.},

abstract = {Genome sequencing projects were long confined to biomedical model organisms and required the concerted effort of large consortia. Rapid progress in high-throughput sequencing technology and the simultaneous development of bioinformatic tools have democratized the field. It is now within reach for individual research groups in the eco-evolutionary and conservation community to generate de novo draft genome sequences for any organism of choice. Because of the cost and considerable effort involved in such an endeavour, the important first step is to thoroughly consider whether a genome sequence is necessary for addressing the biological question at hand. Once this decision is taken, a genome project requires careful planning with respect to the organism involved and the intended quality of the genome draft. Here, we briefly review the state of the art within this field and provide a step-by-step introduction to the workflow involved in genome sequencing, assembly and annotation with particular reference to large and complex genomes. This tutorial is targeted at scientists with a background in conservation genetics, but more generally, provides useful practical guidance for researchers engaging in whole-genome sequencing projects.},

Isolates were tested for eae and VT genes. Risk factors for Dutch veal herds were quantified. For all herd/flock types, faecal samples were cultured for E. coli O157. Of broiler flocks, laying flocks and finishing pig herds, respectively, 1.7{\%}, 0.5{\%} and 0.4{\%} wereE. coli O157 positive. In total, 42 of the 454 veal herds (9.3{\%}) showed at least one positive pooled sample. E. coli O157-positive herds were compared (with logistic regression) to negative herds, regarding variables obtained from the questionnaire taken from the farm manager. To account for season, a sine function was included in the logistic regression as offset variable. In the final model, 'pink-veal production' (compared to white-veal production), 'group housing of the sampled herd' (compared to individual housing), 'more than one stable present' (compared to one stable present), 'hygienic measures regarding visitors' (compared to no hygienic measures), 'interval arrival-sampling of a herd of {\textgreater} 20 weeks' (compared to {\textless}= 10 weeks), and 'presence of other farms within 1 km' (compared to no presence of farms {\textless} 1 km) showed associations (P {\textless} 0.05) with the presence of E. coli O157. These results need careful interpretation; they should be considered as indications for further (experimental or cohort-based) research rather then causal associations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Previously 14 conjugative plasmids from multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli from healthy humans and food-producing animals in Switzerland were sequenced. The aim of this study was to extend the genetic characterization of these plasmids with a focus on bla ESBL genes including bla CTX-M-1 and bla TEM, class 1 integrons and toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems contained therein. METHODS: The nucleotide sequences and subsequent annotation therein of 14 conjugative plasmids were previously determined from their corresponding transconjugants. The TA loci were confirmed by RASTA-Bacteria. RESULTS: Eight of the conjugative plasmids identified were found to encode genes expressing ESBLs. Structural heterogeneity was noted in the regions flanking both the bla CTX-M-1 and bla TEM genes. The bla CTX-M-1 genes were associated with the common insertion sequences ISEcp1 and IS26, and uniquely with an IS5 element in one case; while bla TEM genes were found to be associated with IS26 and Tn2. A new bla TEM-210 gene was identified. Seven class 1 integrons were also identified and assigned into 3 groups, denoted as In54, In369 and In501. Sixteen TA loci belonging to 4 of the TA gene families (relBE, vapBC, ccd and mazEF) were identified on 11 of these plasmids. CONCLUSIONS: Comparative sequence analysis of these plasmids provided data on the structures likely to contribute to sequence diversity associated with these accessory genes, including IS26, ISEcp1 and Tn2. All of them contribute to the dissemination of the corresponding resistance genes located on the different plasmids. There appears to be no association between beta-lactam encoding genes and TA systems.},

However, the mechanism of sub-MIC of antibiotics on the resistant gene transfer is largely unknown. Here, we used Escherichia coli SM10$\lambda$pir in which the RP4 plasmid was chromosomally-integrated as the donor strain, to investigate the effects of sub-MIC of Ciprofloxacin(Cip) or Levofloxacin(Lev) on conjugational transfer of mobilisable plasmid-pUCP24T from SM10$\lambda$pir to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results showed that the transfer frequency was significantly increased by treating E. coli with sub-MIC of Cip or Lev. To investigate the molecular mechanisms, complete transcriptome sequencing was performed. We found that the sub-MIC of Cip or Lev enhanced the expression of several genes on the RP4 plasmid, which was consistent with the conjugation efficiency. Moreover, the expression of genes associated with SOS response in donor SM10$\lambda$pir was increased, but had no correlation with conjugation efficiency. These findings suggested that sub-MIC of Cip or Lev may promote conjugational transfer by up-regulating the expression of conjugation associated genes via an SOS-independent mechanism.},

They have been of considerable interest in food hygiene since biofilms may contain spoilage and pathogenic bacteria which increases post-processing contamination and risk to public health. In addition, biofilm cells are more resistant to cleaning and disinfection processes in the food industry. Biofilm formation is a complex process in which genetic mechanisms and numerous factors such as the properties of substratum and bacterial cell surfaces are involved. In order to further understand the intricate mechanisms behind biofilm formation, various techniques including physical, chemical and molecular methods have been used to establish the possible model of biofilm formation in food industry. Therefore, the importance of bacterial biofilms in food safety control and biofilm formation mechanisms will be discussed in this paper.

These data were calculated to express amounts sold, in metric tonnes, of active ingredient of each package. A population correction unit (PCU) was applied as a proxy for the animal biomass potentially treated with antimicrobial agents. The indicator used to express sales was milligrams of active substance per PCU. RESULTS: Substantial variations in the sales patterns and in the magnitude of sales of veterinary antimicrobial agents, expressed as mg/PCU, between the countries were observed. The proportion of sales, in mg/PCU, of products applicable for treatment of groups or herds of animals (premixes, oral powders and oral solution) varied considerably between the countries. CONCLUSIONS: Some countries reported much lower sales of veterinary antimicrobial agents than others, when expressed as mg/PCU. Sales patterns varied between countries, particularly with respect to pharmaceutical forms. Further studies are needed to understand the factors that explain the observed differences.},

abstract = {Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) is the most common cause of community-acquired and hospital-acquired extraintestinal infections. The hypothesis that human ExPEC may have a food animal reservoir has been a topic of investigation by multiple groups around the world. Experimental studies showing the shared pathogenic potential of human ExPEC and avian pathogenic E. coli suggest that these extraintestinal E. coli may be derived from the same bacterial lineages or share common evolutionary roots. The consistent observation of specific human ExPEC lineages in poultry or poultry products, and rarely in other meat commodities, supports the hypothesis that there may be a poultry reservoir for human ExPEC. The time lag between human ExPEC acquisition (in the intestine) and infection is the fundamental challenge facing studies attempting to attribute ExPEC transmission to poultry or other environmental sources. Even whole genome sequencing efforts to address attribution will struggle with defining meaningful genetic relationships outside of a discrete food-borne outbreak setting. However, if even a fraction of all human ExPEC infections, especially antimicrobial-resistant ExPEC infections, is attributable to the introduction of multidrug-resistant ExPEC lineages through contaminated food product(s), the relevance to public health, food animal production and food safety will be significant.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The already high and increasing occurrence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli in European broiler populations is of concern due to the fact that third and fourth generation cephalosporins are deemed critically important in human medicine. In Sweden 34{\%} of the broilers carry ESBL/pAmpC producing E. coli in their gut, despite the absence of a known selection pressure such as antimicrobial usages. The aim of the current study was to characterise a selection of E. coli strains carrying the blaCTX-M-1, to determine if the spread was due to a specific clone. FINDINGS: Ten isolates carrying blaCTX-M-1 from Swedish broilers belonged to eight different multi-locus sequence types with three isolates belonging to ST155. The ST155 isolates were identical as assessed by PFGE. The blaCTX-M-1 was in all isolates carried on a plasmid of replicon type incI, which also transferred resistance to tetracycline and sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSION: The occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli in the Swedish broilers is not due to the emergence of a single clone, but rather the spread of a specific incI plasmid carrying blaCTX-M-1.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the diversity of integrons and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among Enterobacteriaceae from chickens and swine in Portugal and analyse the clonal relationships between Portuguese ESBL-producing isolates of animal and human origin. METHODS: We analysed samples from faeces of healthy swine (HSF, n = 35), from uncooked chicken carcasses (CM, n = 20) and from faeces of healthy chickens (HCF, n = 20). Samples were plated on MacConkey agar with and without ceftazidime (1 mg/L) or cefotaxime (1 mg/L). ESBLs were characterized by PCR and DNA sequencing. Bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility and conjugation assays were performed by standard procedures. Isolate clonal relatedness was established by PFGE and by RAPD for PFGE non-typeable isolates. Escherichia coli phylogenetic groups were identified by a multiplex PCR. Integron analysis was accomplished by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. RESULTS: ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were identified in 60{\%} of CM, 10{\%} of HCF and 5.7{\%} of HSF samples, respectively, mostly corresponding to E. coli (phylogroups A, D and B1). TEM-52, SHV-2 and CTX-M-1 were detected from chicken and SHV-12 from swine samples. High clonal diversity was observed and most bla(ESBL) genes were transferable (67{\%}). Class 1 and/or class 2 integrons were identified in 80{\%} of CM, 10{\%} of HCF and 63{\%} of HSF samples, with class 1 integrons more common than class 2 integrons (36{\%} versus 12{\%} of the isolates recovered, respectively). Ten class 1 integron types are described, aadA1 and dfrA1-aadA1 being the most frequently found. Two class 1 integron types (aadA13-estX and dfrA14-aadA1-catB2) and one class 2 integron (aadA1) are first reported here. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report of ESBLs and integrons from chickens and swine in Portugal and highlights the antibiotic-resistant bacteria and/or resistance genes that might be acquired by humans through the food chain.},

abstract = {We recently identified clonal complex 10 (CC10) Escherichia coli as the predominant clonal group in two populations of healthy Australian food-production pigs. CC10 are highly successful, colonizing humans, food-production animals, fresh produce and environmental niches. Furthermore, E. coli within CC10 are frequently drug resistant and increasingly reported as human and animal extra-intestinal pathogens. In order to develop a high-resolution global phylogeny and determine the repertoire of antimicrobial-resistance genes, virulence-associated genes and plasmid types within this clonal group, we downloaded 228 publicly available CC10 short-read genome sequences for comparison with 20 porcine CC10 we have previously described. Core genome single nucleotide polymorphism phylogeny revealed a highly diverse global phylogeny consisting of multiple lineages that did not cluster by geography or source of the isolates. Australian porcine strains belonged to several of these divergent lineages, indicative that CC10 is present in these animals due to multiple colonization events. Differences in resistance gene and plasmid carriage between porcine strains and the global collection highlighted the role of lateral gene transfer in the evolution of CC10 strains. Virulence profiles typical of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli were present in both Australian porcine strains and the broader collection. As both the core phylogeny and accessory gene characteristics appeared unrelated to the geography or source of the isolates, it is likely that the global expansion of CC10 is not a recent event and may be associated with faecal carriage in humans.},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence indicate that the most primitive staphylococcal species, those of the Staphylococcus sciuri group, were involved in the first stages of evolution of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCC mec ), the genetic element carrying the $\beta$-lactam resistance gene mecA . However, many steps are still missing from this evolutionary history. In particular, it is not known how mecA was incorporated into the mobile element SCC prior to dissemination among Staphylococcus aureus and other pathogenic staphylococcal species. To gain insights into the possible contribution of several species of the Staphylococcus sciuri group to the assembly of SCC mec , we sequenced the genomes of 106 isolates, comprising S. sciuri ( n = 76), Staphylococcus vitulinus ( n = 18), and Staphylococcus fleurettii ( n = 12) from animal and human sources, and characterized the native location of mecA and the SCC insertion site by using a variety of comparative genomic approaches. Moreover, we performed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of the genomes in order to understand SCC mec evolution in relation to phylogeny. We found that each of three species of the S. sciuri group contributed to the evolution of SCC mec : S. vitulinus and S. fleurettii contributed to the assembly of the mec complex, and S. sciuri most likely provided the mobile element in which mecA was later incorporated. We hypothesize that an ancestral SCC mec III cassette (an element carried by one of the most epidemic methicillin-resistant S. aureus clones) originated in S. sciuri possibly by a recombination event in a human host or a human-created environment and later was transferred to S. aureus .},

abstract = {Objectives: A plasmid-encoded multidrug efflux pump, OqxAB, identified in Escherichia coli of porcine origin, was tested for substrate specificity against selected antibiotics, detergents and disinfectants. The ability of horizontal transfer to food-borne pathogens of the Enterobacteriaceae family was also investigated. Methods: The MICs of selected substrates were determined with a broth dilution assay using two isogenic E. coli strains, except for the presence of the oqxAB operon. A derivative of the plasmid encoding OqxAB (pOLA52) was constructed and horizontal transfer to Salmonella Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Kluyvera sp. and Enterobacter aerogenes was investigated. The effect of the presence of the OqxAB pump on susceptibility for selected compounds was investigated using broth dilution assays. Results: The OqxAB pump conferred antimicrobial resistance or reduced susceptibility towards a variety of substrates in E. coli. These included animal growth promoters, antimicrobials, disinfectants and detergents. pOLA52 could readily be transferred to enterobacterial pathogens. Transconjugants showed reduced susceptibility towards chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and olaquindox. Conclusions: The plasmid-encoded OqxAB pump has a wide substrate specificity and can be transferred between Enterobacteriaceae conferring reduced susceptibility to a multitude of substrates. These results could indicate some dependence on the outer membrane proteins present in the different species. {\textcopyright} The Author 2007.

Isolates resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones, and extended spectrum cephalosporins (n = 331) were compared with drug-susceptible isolates (n = 600) stratified by source. Phylogenetic and virulence markers of drug-susceptible human isolates differed considerably from those of human and poultry isolates. In contrast, drug-resistant human isolates were similar to poultry isolates, and drug-susceptible and drug-resistant poultry isolates were largely indistinguishable. Many drug-resistant human fecal E. coli isolates may originate from poultry, whereas drug-resistant poultry source E. coli isolates likely originate from susceptible poultry-source precursors.},

abstract = {Double mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region of the gyrase A gene (gyrA) have recently been reported to be associated with high-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli. We examined the type and frequency of such mutations in a large number of clinical isolates that were obtained from ten different geographical locations and had been genotypically characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA digests. Of 36 isolates with ofloxacin MICs {\textgreater} or = 4 mg/L that represented at least 24 distinct genotypes, 35 had double mutations at amino acid codons 83 and 87 of gyrA, while two isolates with ofloxacin MICs of 0.5 and 4 mg/L, respectively, each had a single mutation at codon 83. Mutations at codon Ser-83 were uniform, resulting in substitution by Leu. The additional mutations at amino acid codon 87 in the 35 double-mutants were diverse, resulting in Asp-87 substitutions by residues Asn (23 isolates), Gly (7 isolates), Tyr (4 isolates), or His (1 isolate) without a discernable correlation with fluoroquinolone MICs or with phenotypic resistance to chemically unrelated antibacterial agents. Maximal differences between MICs of double-mutants with the same amino acid substitution were eight-fold. The changes of amino acid residues at codon Asp-87 differed between individual patient isolates with the same genotype (and similar MICs), suggesting that the amino acid codon 87 mutations (and possibly the development of high-level fluoroquinolone resistance) might have occurred after the transmission and sharing of a precursor strain carrying the Ser-83--{\textgreater}Leu mutation.},

The new agents include compounds that inhibit macromolecular synthesis or interfere with bacterial membrane function. Apart from the oxazolidinones and cationic peptides, the remainder of these new compounds are analogues of earlier antibiotic classes; therefore, it is probable that existing resistance mechanisms will adapt to accommodate the new derivatives. To minimise the potential for emergence of resistance to new agents, research strategies should be chosen that not only enhance the discovery of structurally novel drugs, but also direct these to new molecular targets that may themselves have decreased potential to give rise to drug-resistant variants.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli are a common inhabitant of the gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds; nevertheless, they may be associated with a variety of severe and invasive infections. Whereas fluoroquinolones (FQ) have been banned in the United States for use in poultry production, the use of these antimicrobials in poultry husbandry is still possible in the European Union, although with some restrictions. The aim of this study was to investigate the FQ resistance of 235 E. coli isolates recovered from chickens and turkeys. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by a microdilution method, whereas mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the target genes, gyrA and parC, were detected by a PCR-based method. High resistance rates ({\textgreater}60{\%}) were observed for nalidixic acid, flumequine, and difloxacin, whereas resistance to ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, and sarafloxacin was less frequently reported ({\textless}40{\%}). Sixty-four isolates (27.2{\%}) showed full susceptibility toward the tested FQ, but 57 isolates (24.2{\%}) were resistant to all tested FQ. The remaining 114 E. coli isolates (48.5{\%}) were grouped in 5 different resistance patterns. Isolates resistant only to flumequine or nalidixic acid or both possessed 1 gyrA mutation, whereas isolates with further resistance to enrofloxacin, difloxacin, danofloxacin, and sarafloxacin had in addition 1 or 2 parC substitutions. Two gyrA mutations coupled with 1 substitution in parC were detected in isolates resistant to all tested FQ. The number of mutations and their correlation with the in vitro activity of FQ reflected the currently accepted model, according to which a single gyrA substitution is associated with resistance or decreased susceptibility to older quinolones, whereas further gyrA or parC substitutions are needed for a higher level of resistance.},

abstract = {Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in microbial organisms have the potential to vastly improve the way we understand, manage, and treat infectious diseases. Yet, GWAS methods established thus far remain insufficiently able to capitalise on the growing wealth of bacterial and viral genetic sequence data. Facing clonal population structure and homologous recombination, existing GWAS methods struggle to achieve both the precision necessary to reject spurious findings and the power required to detect associations in microbes. In this paper, we introduce a novel phylogenetic approach that has been tailor-made for microbial GWAS, which is applicable to organisms ranging from purely clonal to frequently recombining, and to both binary and continuous phenotypes. Our approach is robust to the confounding effects of both population structure and recombination, while maintaining high statistical power to detect associations. Thorough testing via application to simulated data provides strong support for the power and specificity of our approach and demonstrates the advantages offered over alternative cluster-based and dimension-reduction methods. Two applications to Neisseria meningitidis illustrate the versatility and potential of our method, confirming previously-identified penicillin resistance loci and resulting in the identification of both well-characterised and novel drivers of invasive disease. Our method is implemented as an open-source R package called treeWAS which is freely available at https://github.com/caitiecollins/treeWAS.},

abstract = {The degree to which molecular epidemiology reveals information about the sources and transmission patterns of an outbreak depends on the resolution of the technology used and the samples studied. Isolates of Escherichia coli O104:H4 from the outbreak centered in Germany in May-July 2011, and the much smaller outbreak in southwest France in June 2011, were indistinguishable by standard tests. We report a molecular epidemiological analysis using multiplatform whole-genome sequencing and analysis of multiple isolates from the German and French outbreaks. Isolates from the German outbreak showed remarkably little diversity, with only two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in isolates from four individuals. Surprisingly, we found much greater diversity (19 SNPs) in isolates from seven individuals infected in the French outbreak. The German isolates form a clade within the more diverse French outbreak strains. Moreover, five isolates derived from a single infected individual from the French outbreak had extremely limited diversity. The striking difference in diversity between the German and French outbreak samples is consistent with several hypotheses, including a bottleneck that purged diversity in the German isolates, variation in mutation rates in the two E. coli outbreak populations, or uneven distribution of diversity in the seed populations that led to each outbreak.},

abstract = {To identify forces shaping the Escherichia coli intraspecies ecological structure, we have characterized in terms of phylogenetic group (A, B1, D and B2) belonging, presence/absence of extraintestinal virulence genes (pap, sfa, hly and aer) and intra-host phylotype diversity a collection of 1898 commensal isolates originating from 387 animals (birds and mammals) sampled in the 1980s and the 2000s. These data have been compared with 760 human commensal isolates, sampled from 152 healthy subjects in the 2000s, and analysed with the same approach. The prevalence of the E. coli phylogenetic groups in birds, non-human mammals and humans is clearly different with a predominance of D/B1, A/B1 and A/B2 strains respectively. A major force shaping the ecological structure is the environment with a strong effect of domestication and the year of sampling followed by the climate. Host characteristics, as the diet and body mass, also influence the ecological structure. Human microbiota are characterized by a higher prevalence of virulence genes and a lower intra-host diversity than the non-human mammal ones. This work identifies for the first time a group of strains specific to the animals, the B1 phylogenetic group strains exhibiting the hly gene. In conclusion, a complex network of factors seems to shape the ecological structure of commensal E. coli, with anthropogenic factors playing a major role and perturbing natural niche equilibrium.},

abstract = {The specific antimicrobial resistance (AMR) decreases that can be expected from reducing antimicrobial (AM) use in United States (US) beef production have not been defined. To address this data gap, feces were recovered from 36 lots of âraised without antibioticsâ (RWA) and 36 lots of âconventionalâ (CONV) beef cattle. Samples (N = 719) were collected during harvest and distributed over a year. AMR was assessed by: i) culture of six AM-resistant bacteria (ARB); ii) qPCR for 10 AMR genes (ARGs); iii) an qPCR array of 84 ARGs; and iv) metagenomic sequencing. Generally, AMR levels were similar, but some were higher in CONV. The prevalence of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GC r ) Escherichia coli was marginally different between production systems (47.5 {\%} CONV, 34.8{\%} RWA, P = 0.04), but the seasonal effect (92.8{\%} summer, 48.3{\%} winter, P {\textless} 0.01) was greater. Erythromycin-resistant (ERY r ) Enterococcus spp. concentrations significantly differed between production systems (CONV = 1.91 log 10 CFU/g, RWA = 0.73 log 10 CFU/g, P {\textless} 0.01). Levels of aadA1 , ant(6)-I , bla ACI , erm (A), erm (B), erm (C), erm (F), erm (Q), tet (A), tet (B), tet (M), and tet (X) ARGs were higher ( P {\textless} 0.05) in CONV. Aggregate abundances of all 43 ARGs detected by metagenomic sequencing and the aggregate abundances of ARGs in the aminoglycoside, $\beta$-lactam, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLS B ), and tetracycline AM classes did not differ (log 2 fold change {\textless} 1.0) between CONV and RWA. These results suggest that further reductions of AM use in US beef cattle production may not yield significant AMR reductions beyond MLS B and tetracycline resistance.},

abstract = {Fluoroquinolone resistance is mainly caused by mutations in quinolone resistance-determining regions of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV in Escherichia coli. The AcrAB-TolC efflux pump contributes to resistance against fluoroquinolone and other antimicrobials. In this study, we investigated a high-level mechanism of fluoroquinolone resistance in E. coli that was isolated from human clinical samples and canine fecal samples. E. coli strains with high levels of fluoroquinolone resistance have been found to be frequently resistant to cephalosporins. Strains with high-level fluoroquinolone resistance exhibited lower intracellular enrofloxacin (ENR) concentrations, higher expression of AcrA, and a greater reduction in the fluoroquinolone minimum inhibitory concentration for treatment with an efflux pump inhibitor. The frequency of strains with enhanced ENR resistance selection and the survival rate of E. coli in the presence of ENR in vitro were correlated well with AcrA protein expression levels in the parental strains. These results suggest that AcrAB-TolC efflux pump over-expression is related to high-level fluoroquinolone resistance and the selection of strains with enhanced fluoroquinolone resistance.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a global challenge that impacts all pharmaceutically used antibiotics. The origin of the genes associated with this resistance is of significant importance to our understanding of the evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance in pathogens. A growing body of evidence implicates environmental organisms as reservoirs of these resistance genes; however, the role of anthropogenic use of antibiotics in the emergence of these genes is controversial. We report a screen of a sample of the culturable microbiome of Lechuguilla Cave, New Mexico, in a region of the cave that has been isolated for over 4 million years. We report that, like surface microbes, these bacteria were highly resistant to antibiotics; some strains were resistant to 14 different commercially available antibiotics. Resistance was detected to a wide range of structurally different antibiotics including daptomycin, an antibiotic of last resort in the treatment of drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens. Enzyme-mediated mechanisms of resistance were also discovered for natural and semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotics via glycosylation and through a kinase-mediated phosphorylation mechanism. Sequencing of the genome of one of the resistant bacteria identified a macrolide kinase encoding gene and characterization of its product revealed it to be related to a known family of kinases circulating in modern drug resistant pathogens. The implications of this study are significant to our understanding of the prevalence of resistance, even in microbiomes isolated from human use of antibiotics. This supports a growing understanding that antibiotic resistance is natural, ancient, and hard wired in the microbial pangenome.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown that nonenzymatic glycosylation of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) inhibits high-affinity binding to cultured cells and the candidate HDL-receptor protein. Because binding of HDL to its receptor is required for HDL-receptor-mediated cholesterol efflux from cells, we hypothesized that glycosylated HDL3 would have reduced ability to remove cholesterol from cells. HDL3 was glycosylated in vitro to achieve up to 40-50{\%} reductions in free-lysine residues. Glycosylated HDL3 had a slightly greater ability than control HDL3 to sequester cholesterol directly from the plasma membrane, as predicted by changes in lipid composition. This process is independent of HDL-receptor binding and should not be influenced by reduced binding of HDL3. In contrast, efflux of intracellular cholesterol from cells, which is HDL-receptor dependent, was reduced 25-40{\%}. The ability of glycosylated HDL3 to diminish cholesterol esterification was significantly reduced, indicating reduced net cholesterol efflux. Steady-state efflux of LDL-derived cholesterol was also markedly reduced. These findings suggest that nonenzymatically glycosylated HDL is functionally abnormal and might contribute to the accelerated development of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes mellitus.},

abstract = {After two decades of the discovery of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR), three different mechanisms have been associated to this phenomenon: target protection (Qnr proteins, including several families with multiple alleles), active efflux pumps (mainly QepA and OqxAB pumps) and drug modification [AAC(6â²)-Ib-cr acetyltransferase]. PMQR genes are usually associated with mobile or transposable elements on plasmids, and, in the case of qnr genes, are often incorporated into sul1-type integrons. PMQR has been found in clinical and environmental isolates around the world and appears to be spreading.

We included 219 MGEs described in 7 Enterobacteriaceae species isolated from human, animal and environmental samples. Despite a high overall diversity, 2 lineages were observed in the E. coli population that may function as reservoirs of the mcr-1 gene, the largest of which was linked to ST10, a sequence type known for its ubiquity in human faecal samples and in food samples. No genotypic clustering by geographical origin or isolation source was observed. Amongst a total of 13 plasmid incompatibility types, the IncI2, IncX4 and IncHI2 plasmids accounted for more than 90{\%} of MGEs carrying the mcr-1 gene. We observed significant geographical clustering with regional spread of IncHI2 plasmids in Europe and IncI2 in Asia. These findings point towards promiscuous spread of the mcr-1 gene by efficient horizontal gene transfer dominated by a limited number of plasmid incompatibility types.},

abstract = {Poultry feed is at the start of the food safety chain in the "farm-to-fork" model, and might serve as a source of antimicrobial resistant bacteria present in poultry meat. Antimicrobial resistance was investigated in 1137 enterococci and 163 Escherichia coli strains recovered from 23 samples of commercial broiler feed and 66 samples of raw feeding materials taken over half a year timespan. Enumeration of enterococci and E. coli were also performed using traditional plating and fluorescent in situ hybridisation methods. Viable enterococci were detected in all feed samples and in 66{\%} of samples of separate feed ingredients, while E. coli was present in 50{\%} and 32{\%} of feed and raw feeding materials, respectively. The median values (50th percentile) for plate and FISH counts for feeds were, respectively, 2.70 log CFU/g and 5.52 log cells/g for enterococci, and 0.15 log CFU/g and 6.00 log cells/g for E. coli. Among enterococci recovered from feed ingredients, resistance to rifampicin, erythromycin, nitrofurantoin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin was found in 59.8{\%}, 21.6{\%}, 21.2{\%}, 18.0{\%} and 6.9{\%} of the isolates, respectively. A considerable proportion of the enterococci isolates obtained from broiler feed displayed resistance to tetracycline (69.1{\%}), rifampicin (58.5{\%}), erythromycin (52.9{\%}) and nitrofurantoin (36.2{\%}). Lower percentage of resistance was observed to chloramphenicol (4.6{\%}), ciprofloxacin (3.9{\%}), vancomycin (1.9{\%}) and ampicillin (1.2{\%}). Among E. coli recovered from feed ingredients and poultry feeds, resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and streptomycin was found in 22.9{\%}, 27.6{\%} and 19.0{\%} and in 22.4{\%}, 41.4{\%} and 17.0{\%} of the isolates, respectively. These data show that feedstuffs and poultry feeds are extensively contaminated by resistant enterococci and, in a lesser extent, by E. coli, thus leading to their introduction in the farm environment. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The presence of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) or transferable AmpC beta-lactamases (pAmpC) is increasingly being reported in humans and animals world-wide. Their occurrence in food-producing animals suggests that meat is a possible link between the two populations. This study investigated the occurrence and characteristics of Salmonella and ESBL- or pAmpC-producing E. coli in 430 samples of beef, pork and broiler meat imported into Sweden, in order to provide data required for assessing the potential public health risk of these bacteria in food. Depending on region of origin, ESBL/pAmpC-producing E. coli were found in 0-8{\%} of beef samples, 2-13{\%} of pork samples and 15-95{\%} of broiler meat samples. The highest prevalence was in South American broiler meat (95{\%}), followed by broiler meat from Europe (excluding Denmark) (61{\%}) and from Denmark (15{\%}). Isolates from meat outside Scandinavia were generally defined as multiresistant. A majority of the ESBL/pAmpC genes were transferable by conjugation. Bla(CTX-M-2) and bla(CTX-M-8) were the dominant genes in E. coli from South American broiler meat, whereas bla(CMY-2) and bla(CTX-M-1) dominated in European meat. The majority of bla(CMY-2) and bla(CTX-M-1) were situated on plasmids of replicon type incK and incI1, respectively. The same combinations of ESBL/pAmpC genes and plasmids have been described previously in clinical human isolates. Salmonella was found in five samples tested, from European pork and broiler meat. No Salmonella isolate was resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. In conclusion, meat imported into Sweden, broiler meat in particular, is a potential source of human exposure to ESBL- and pAmpC-producing E. coli.},

abstract = {Multi-country outbreaks of foodborne bacterial disease present challenges in their detection, tracking, and notification. As food is increasingly distributed across borders, such outbreaks are becoming more common. This increases the need for high-resolution, accessible, and replicable isolate typing schemes. Here we evaluate a core genome multilocus typing (cgMLST) scheme for the high-resolution reproducible typing of Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) isolates, by its application to a large European outbreak of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis. This outbreak had been extensively characterised using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based approaches. The cgMLST analysis was congruent with the original SNP-based analysis, the epidemiological data, and whole genome MLST (wgMLST) analysis. Combination of the cgMLST and epidemiological data confirmed that the genetic diversity among the isolates predated the outbreak, and was likely present at the infection source. There was consequently no link between country of isolation and genetic diversity, but the cgMLST clusters were congruent with date of isolation. Furthermore, comparison with publicly available Enteritidis isolate data demonstrated that the cgMLST scheme presented is highly scalable, enabling outbreaks to be contextualised within the Salmonella genus. The cgMLST scheme is therefore shown to be a standardised and scalable typing method, which allows Salmonella outbreaks to be analysed and compared across laboratories and jurisdictions.},

abstract = {Hypermutability is a phenotype characterized by a moderate to high elevation of spontaneous mutation rates and could result from DNA replication errors, defects in error correction mechanisms and many other causes. The elevated mutation rates are helpful to organisms to adapt to sudden and unforeseen threats to survival. At the same time hypermutability also leads to the generation of many deleterious mutations which offset its adaptive value and therefore disadvantageous. Nevertheless, it is very common in nature, especially among clinical isolates of pathogens. Hypermutability is inherited by indirect (second order) selection along with the beneficial mutations generated. At large population sizes and high mutation rates many cells in the population could concurrently acquire beneficial mutations of varying adaptive (fitness) values. These lineages compete with the ancestral cells and also among themselves for fixation. The one with the 'fittest' mutation gets fixed ultimately while the others are lost. This has been called 'clonal interference' which puts a speed limit on adaptation. The original clonal interference hypothesis has been modified recently. Nonheritable (transient) hypermtability conferring significant adaptive benefits also occur during stress response although its molecular basis remains controversial. The adaptive benefits of heritable hypermutability are discussed with emphasis on host-pathogen interactions.},

abstract = {Our understanding of Escherichia coli biofilm formation in vitro is based on studies of laboratory K-12 strains grown in standard media. However, pathogenic E. coli isolates differ substantially in their genetic repertoire from E. coli K-12 and are subject to heterogeneous environmental conditions. In this study, in vitro biofilm formation of 331 nondomesticated E. coli strains isolated from healthy (n = 105) and diarrhea-afflicted children (n = 68), bacteremia patients (n = 90), and male patients with urinary tract infections (n = 68) was monitored using a variety of growth conditions and compared to in vitro biofilm formation of prototypic pathogenic and laboratory strains. Our results revealed remarkable variation among the capacities of diverse E. coli isolates to form biofilms in vitro. Notably, we could not identify an association of increased biofilm formation in vitro with a specific strain collection that represented pathogenic E. coli strains. Instead, analysis of biofilm data revealed a significant dependence on growth medium composition (P {\textless} 0.05). Poor correlation between biofilm formation in the various media suggests that diverse E. coli isolates respond very differently to changing environmental conditions. The data demonstrate that prevalence and expression of three factors known to strongly promote biofilm formation in E. coli K-12 (F-like conjugative pili, aggregative adherence fimbriae, and curli) cannot adequately account for the increased biofilm formation of nondomesticated E. coli isolates in vitro. This study highlights the complexity of genetic and environmental effectors of the biofilm phenotype within the species E. coli.},

abstract = {Saponins are detergent-like substances showing antibacterial as well as anticancer potential. In this study, the effects of saponins from Quillaja saponaria were analyzed against prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Multidrug-resistant clinical E. coli strains were isolated from human urine. As eukaryotic cells, the CHO-K1 cell lines were applied. Antibacterial effect of ampicillin, streptomycin, and ciprofloxacin in the presence of saponins was measured by cultivation methods. Properties of saponins against CHO-K1 cells were measured by the MTT test, hemolysis assay and flow cytometry. Saponin from Quillaja saponaria has a cytotoxic effect at concentrations higher than 25 $\mu$ g/mL and in the range of 12â50 $\mu$ g/mL significantly increases the level of early apoptotic cells. Saponin at dose of 12 $\mu$ g/mL enhances the six E. coli strains growth. We postulate that saponins increase the influx of nutrients from the medium into E. coli cells. Saponins do not have synergetic effects on antibacterial action of tested antibiotics. In contrary, in the presence of saponins and antibiotics, more CFU/mL E. coli cells were observed. This effect was similar to saponins action alone towards E. coli cells. In conclusion, saponins was cytotoxic against CHO-K1 cells, whereas against E. coli cells this effect was not observed.},

abstract = {The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria has been a rising problem for public health in recent decades. It is becoming increasingly recognized that not only antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) encountered in clinical pathogens are of relevance, but rather, all pathogenic, commensal as well as environmental bacteria-and also mobile genetic elements and bacteriophages-form a reservoir of ARGs (the resistome) from which pathogenic bacteria can acquire resistance via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). HGT has caused antibiotic resistance to spread from commensal and environmental species to pathogenic ones, as has been shown for some clinically important ARGs. Of the three canonical mechanisms of HGT, conjugation is thought to have the greatest influence on the dissemination of ARGs. While transformation and transduction are deemed less important, recent discoveries suggest their role may be larger than previously thought. Understanding the extent of the resistome and how its mobilization to pathogenic bacteria takes place is essential for efforts to control the dissemination of these genes. Here, we will discuss the concept of the resistome, provide examples of HGT of clinically relevant ARGs and present an overview of the current knowledge of the contributions the various HGT mechanisms make to the spread of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {During the past two decades, the technological progress of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) had changed the fields of Environmental Microbiology and Biotechnology, and, currently, is changing the underlying principles, approaches, and fundamentals of Public Health, Epidemiology, Health Economics, and national productivity. Today's WGS technologies are able to compete with conventional techniques in cost, speed, accuracy, and resolution for day-to-day control of infectious diseases and outbreaks in clinical laboratories and in long-term epidemiological investigations. WGS gives rise to an exciting future direction for personalized Genomic Epidemiology. One of the most vital and growing public health problems is the emerging and re-emerging of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections in the communities and healthcare settings, reinforced by a decline in antimicrobial drug discovery. In recent years, retrospective analysis provided by WGS has had a great impact on the identification and tracking of MDR microorganisms in hospitals and communities. The obtained genomic data are also important for developing novel easy-to-use diagnostic assays for clinics, as well as for antibiotic and therapeutic development at both the personal and population levels. At present, this technology has been successfully applied as an addendum to the real-time diagnostic methods currently used in clinical laboratories. However, the significance of WGS for public health may increase if: (a) unified and user-friendly bioinformatics toolsets for easy data interpretation and management are established, and (b) standards for data validation and verification are developed. Herein, we review the current and future impact of this technology on diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and control of MDR infectious bacteria in clinics and on the global scale.},

abstract = {This study explored the prevalence and persistence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium from healthy broilers. In 32 broiler farms, cloacal samples were taken during two production rounds, with one production round in between. For 10 of the sampled flocks, samples from the carcasses at the slaughterhouse were also collected. For E. coli, high levels of resistance were found for ampicillin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, tetracycline, and the combination of trimethoprim and sulfonamide. Over 58{\%} of all the isolates showed resistance to four or more antimicrobial agents. Only 4.8{\%} were fully susceptible for all 14 drugs tested. A remarkably high resistance rate (up to 41{\%}) to ceftiofur was found. The enterococci were frequently resistant to macrolides, tetracycline, and the combination quinopristin/dalfopristin. Over 80{\%} displayed acquired resistance to four or more antimicrobial agents, and 3.9{\%} were fully susceptible for the eight agents tested. Resistance was found to persist over consecutive production rounds. There was a good correlation between results obtained with cloacal samples of the live animals and caecal content samples collected in the slaughterhouse for both E. coli and E. faecium. For E. coli but not for E. faecium, the resistance profile of neck skin isolates was different from that of cloacal isolates.},

@article{Nicolas-Chanoine2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concomitant with the recent emergence of CTX-M-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), Escherichia coli has become the enterobacterial species most affected by ESBLs. Multiple locales are encountering CTX-M-positive E. coli, including specifically CTX-M-15. To gain insights into the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we assessed clonality and diversity of virulence profiles within an international collection of CTX-M-15-positive E. coli. METHODS: Forty-one ESBL-positive E. coli isolates from eight countries and three continents (Europe, Asia and North America) were selected for study based on suspected clonality. Phylogenetic group, ERIC2 PCR profile, O H serotype, AmpC variant and antibiotic susceptibility were determined. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and PFGE provided additional discrimination. Virulence potential was inferred by detection of 46 virulence factor (VF) genes. RESULTS: Thirty-six (88{\%}) of the 41 E. coli isolates exhibited the same set of core characteristics: phylogenetic group B2, ERIC2 PCR profile 1, serotype O25:H4, AmpC EC6, ciprofloxacin resistance and MLST profile ST131. By PFGE, the 36 isolates constituted one large cluster at the 68{\%} similarity level; this comprised 17 PFGE groups (defined at 85{\%} similarity), some of which included strains from different countries. The 36 isolates exhibited highly (91{\%} to 100{\%}) similar VF profiles. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a broadly disseminated, CTX-M-15-positive and virulent E. coli clonal group with highly homogeneous virulence genotypes and subgroups exhibiting highly similar PFGE profiles, suggesting recent emergence. Understanding how this clone has emerged and successfully disseminated within the hospital and community, including across national boundaries, should be a public health priority.},

abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

abstract = {There is extensive genetic substructure within the species Escherichia coli. In 2000 a simple triplex PCR method was described by Clermont and colleagues that enables an E. coli isolate to be assigned to one of the phylo-groups A, B1, B2 or D. The growing body of multi-locus sequence data and genome data for E. coli has refined our understanding of E. coli's phylo-group structure and eight phylo-groups are now recognized: seven (A, B1, B2, C, D, E, F) belong to E. coli sensu stricto, whereas the eighth is the Escherichia cryptic clade I. Here a new PCR-based method is developed that enables an E. coli isolate to be assigned to one of the eight phylo-groups and which allows isolates that are members of the other cryptic clades (II to V) of Escherichia to be identified. The development of the method is described and the method is validated. Over 95{\%} of E. coli isolates can be correctly assigned to a phylo-group. Two collections of human faecal isolates were screened using the new phylo-group assignment method demonstrating that about 13{\%} of E. coli isolates belong to the newly described phylo-groups C, E, F and clade I.},

@article{Touchon2009,
abstract = {The Escherichia coli species represents one of the best-studied model organisms, but also encompasses a variety of commensal and pathogenic strains that diversify by high rates of genetic change. We uniformly (re-) annotated the genomes of 20 commensal and pathogenic E. coli strains and one strain of E. fergusonii (the closest E. coli related species), including seven that we sequenced to completion. Within the approximately 18,000 families of orthologous genes, we found approximately 2,000 common to all strains. Although recombination rates are much higher than mutation rates, we show, both theoretically and using phylogenetic inference, that this does not obscure the phylogenetic signal, which places the B2 phylogenetic group and one group D strain at the basal position. Based on this phylogeny, we inferred past evolutionary events of gain and loss of genes, identifying functional classes under opposite selection pressures. We found an important adaptive role for metabolism diversification within group B2 and Shigella strains, but identified few or no extraintestinal virulence-specific genes, which could render difficult the development of a vaccine against extraintestinal infections. Genome flux in E. coli is confined to a small number of conserved positions in the chromosome, which most often are not associated with integrases or tRNA genes. Core genes flanking some of these regions show higher rates of recombination, suggesting that a gene, once acquired by a strain, spreads within the species by homologous recombination at the flanking genes. Finally, the genome's long-scale structure of recombination indicates lower recombination rates, but not higher mutation rates, at the terminus of replication. The ensuing effect of background selection and biased gene conversion may thus explain why this region is A+T-rich and shows high sequence divergence but low sequence polymorphism. Overall, despite a very high gene flow, genes co-exist in an organised genome.},

Antimicrobial resistance was tested in Escherichia coli isolated from feces (n = 660) of red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, European bison, and wild boar shot in regional forests in Poland during two winter hunting seasons. Indicator E. coli (n = 542) was resistant against 11 of 14 tested compounds, mostly sulfamethoxazole, streptomycin, ampicillin, trimethoprim, and tetracycline (1.3-6.6{\%} range). No significant differences were observed between boar and ruminant isolates. Most of deer and bison isolates showed no resistance. Selective screening of wildlife samples revealed 1.7{\%} prevalence of cephalosporin-resistant E. coli found mostly in wild boars. They produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-15) and plasmid-mediated AmpC-type cephalosporinase (blaCMY-2). The majority of the isolates originated from boars shot in a narrow time frame and space; therefore, common antimicrobial selection pressure in the environment was assumed. Three E. coli isolates carried plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes (qnrS1/S3). No transferable colistin resistance mechanisms were found in two resistant E. coli. Transferability of resistance was proved in a single pAmpC-positive isolate carrying IncI1-alpha 95 kb plasmid. No cephalosporin-resistant E. coli harbored pathogenicity markers; therefore, they might be considered a vector of resistance determinants, but not a pathogen themselves.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To characterize the CTX-M-15-encoding plasmid in a Klebsiella pneumoniae ST17 strain, responsible for an outbreak at a Norwegian neonatal intensive care unit and subsequent colonization of affected children for up to two years. To identify plasmid-mediated features relevant for the outbreak dynamics, and to investigate the plasmids capability of horizontal transfer, its segregational stability and plasmid-mediated fitness costs. METHODS: Plasmid profiling was performed by S1-nuclease PFGE, PCR-based replicon typing and Southern blot-hybridization. The complete sequence of the CTX-M-15-encoding plasmid was obtained by 454 sequencing. Plasmid self-transferability was investigated by broth- and filter mating, segregational stability was explored by serial passage, and plasmid-conferred fitness costs were examined in pairwise head-to-head competitions and by growth rate comparisons. RESULTS: CTX-M-15 was encoded by a {\~{}}180 kb IncFIIK plasmid in K. pneumoniae ST17. S1-nuclease PFGE profiles of the first and the last CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae isolates, recovered from the four children colonized the longest, suggested that the plasmid was stably maintained during intestinal carriage of up to two years. The DNA sequence of the pKPN3-like plasmid, pKp848CTX, uncovered a Tn3-like antibiotic resistance region and multiple heavy metal- and thermoresistance determinants. Plasmid pKp848CTX could not be transferred to Escherichia coli in vitro and we found no evidence to support horizontal plasmid transfer in vivo. Segregational plasmid loss ranging from 0.83{\%} to 17.5{\%} was demonstrated in evolved populations in vitro, but only minor fitness costs were associated with plasmid-carriage. CONCLUSIONS: Plasmid pKp848CTX encodes phenotypic traits, which may have had an impact on the fitness and survival of the K. pneumoniae ST17 strain in the outbreak setting. The antibiotic resistance plasmid pKp848CTX was stably maintained during two years of intestinal colonization, conferring negligible fitness cost to its host, and thus seem well adapted to its K. pneumoniae host.},

@article{Ariza1994,
abstract = {Resistance to multiple antibiotics and certain oxidative stress compounds was conferred by three independently selected mutations (marR1, soxQ1, and cfxB1) that mapped to 34 min on the Escherichia coli chromosome. Mutations at this locus can activate the marRAB operon, in which marR encodes a putative repressor of mar transcription and marA encodes a putative transcriptional activator of defense genes against antibiotics and oxidants. Overexpression of the wild-type MarR protein reversed the phenotypes (antibiotic resistance and increased antioxidant enzyme synthesis) of all three mutants. DNA sequence analysis showed that, like marR1, the other two mutations were alterations of marR: a 285-bp deletion in cfxB1 and a GC--{\textgreater}AT transition at codon 70 (Ala--{\textgreater}Thr) in soxQ1. All three mutations cause increased amounts of mar-specific RNA, which supports the hypothesis that MarR has a repressor function in the expression of the marRAB operon. The level of mar RNA was further induced by tetracycline in both the marR1 and soxQ1 strains but not in the cfxB1 deletion mutant. In the cfxB1 strain, the level of expression of a truncated RNA, with or without tetracycline exposure, was the same as the fully induced level in the other two mutants. Overproduction of MarR in the cfxB1 strain repressed the transcription of the truncated RNA and restored transcriptional inducibility by tetracycline. Thus, induction of the marRAB operon results from the relief of the repression exerted by MarR. The marRAB operon evidently activates both antibiotic resistance and oxidative stress genes.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION A classification scheme for ?-lactamases based on functional characteristics is presented. Three major groups of enzymes are defined by their substrate and inhibitor profiles: group 1 cephalosporinases that are not well inhibited by clavulanic acid; group 2 penicillinases, cephalosporinases, and broad- spectrum ?-lactamases that are generally inhibited by active site-directed ?-lactamase inhibitors; and the group 3 metallo- ?-lactamases that hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems and that are poorly inhibited by almost all ?-lac- tam-containing molecules. Functional characteristics have been correlated with molecular structure in a dendrogram for those enzymes with known amino acid sequences. ?-Lactamases (EC 3.5.2.6) have been designated by the No- menclature Committee of the International Union of Bio- chemistry as ââenzymes hydrolysing amides, amidines and other CON bonds . . . separated on the basis of the substrate: . . . cyclic amides'' (323). These enzymes are the major cause of bacterial resistance to ?-lactam antibiotics and have been the subject of extensive microbiological, biochemical, and genetic investigations. Investigators have described more than 190 unique bacterial proteins with the ability to interact with the variety of ?-lactam-containing molecules that can serve as substrates or inhibitors (45, 46, 129, 184; this minireview). Because of the diversity of enzymatic characteristics of the ?-lactama- ses, many attempts have been made to categorize these en- zymes by using their biochemical attributes.},

These strains were isolated from food products (23) and faecal samples from humans (15) and healthy animals (42). Thirteen nalidixic acid-susceptible (NALS) E. coli strains were also analysed. Mutations in gyrA and parC genes were studied by PCR and sequencing. No amino acid changes were detected in GyrA or ParC proteins of the 13 NALS strains. A single change in the GyrA protein was detected in all 61 NALR strains with ciprofloxacin MICs {\textless}/= 2 mg/L with the following substitutions (number of strains): Ser-83--{\textgreater}Leu (54), Ser-83--{\textgreater}Ala (one), Ser-83--{\textgreater}Val (one), Asp-87--{\textgreater}Asn (two), Asp-87--{\textgreater}Tyr (two) and Asp-87--{\textgreater}Gly (one). A double change in GyrA was found in 18 of 19 NALR strains with ciprofloxacin MICs {\textgreater}/= 4 mg/L. Amino acid substitutions were Ser-83--{\textgreater}Leu, with an additional change [Asp-87--{\textgreater}Asn (15), Asp-87--{\textgreater}Tyr (two) or Asp-87--{\textgreater}His (one)].

abstract = {In 1964 Robin Holliday (1) proposed the correction of DNA base pair mismatches within recombination intermediates as the basis for gene conversion. The existence of the mismatch repair systems implied by this proposal is now well established. Activities that recognize and process base pairing errors within the DNA helix have been identified in bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. However, the functions and mechanisms of such systems are best understood in Escherichia coli, an organism that possesses at least three distinct mismatch correction pathways. These three systems are involved not only in the processing of recombination intermediates but also contribute in a major way to the genetic stability of the organism, a function anticipated for mismatch repair by Tiraby and Fox and by Wagner and Meselson. The significance of mismatch correction in the maintenance of low spontaneous mutability becomes apparent when one considers that seven E. coli mutator genes (dam, mutD, mutH, mutL, mutS, mutU, and mutY) have been implicated in mismatch repair. This minireview will summarize information on the most extensively studied E. coli system for mismatch correction, the methyl-directed pathway for processing of DNA biosynthetic errors and intermediates in genetic recombination. A discussion of other E. coli mismatch correction systems may be found in the recent literature and in several recent reviews. Mismatch repair pathways in other organisms and descriptions of the structural properties of mispaired bases may also be found in several of these reviews.},

abstract = {á° The presence of aac(6Ð)-Ib-cr is associated with decreased susceptibility to aminoglycosides (kanamycin, amikacin, and tobramycin) and to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin (9). This al-lelic variant of aac(6Ð)-Ib was found to be linked to the extended-spectrum â¤-lactamase (ESBL) gene bla CTX-M-15 in isolates from many countries (4, 6, 7), while association of aac(6Ð)-Ib with the bla CTX-M-2 ESBL gene has been widely reported in Uruguay and Argentina (3, 11). In this work we looked for the presence of aac(6Ð)-Ib and the aac(6Ð)-Ib-cr variant and their putative ESBL coresistance markers in fecal isolates of enterobacteria resistant to cipro-floxacin and/or ceftazidime from inpatients in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Montevideo, Uruguay. From 1 March to 31 October 2006, 106 patients were admitted to this ICU and followed daily until discharge. Rectal swabs obtained at 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16 days after admission were plated on MacConkey agar plus ceftazidime (4 mg/liter) or ciprofloxacin (2 mg/liter). Enterobacterial isolates were identified by classical methods, including only the first isolate of each bacterial species per patient in this study. Antibiotic resistance profiling, screening, and confirmatory testing for ESBL detection were performed by disk diffusion assay, and results were interpreted following the CLSI guide-lines (2). A total of 58/106 patients (55.2{\%}) were colonized with cip-rofloxacin-and/or ceftazidime-resistant enterobacteria, and 68 isolates were included in this study. Of these, 48 were resistant to gentamicin and 24 to amikacin (Table 1). All aminoglycoside-resistant isolates were screened for aac(6Ð)-Ib by PCR; amplicons were analyzed by restriction with BstF5I, as described by Park et al. (8). PCR products that were not digested by the enzyme [tentatively assigned to aac(6Ð)-Ib-cr] were confirmed to contain aac(6Ð)-Ib-cr by double-strand sequencing. Only two Escherichia coli isolates were positive for aac(6Ð)-Ib-cr detection. Recalling the observed links between bla CTX-M-15 and aac(6Ð)Ib-cr (4, 6, 7) and between aac(6Ð)Ib and bla CTX-M-2 , the two aac(6Ð)-Ib-cr-positive isolates were further analyzed by PCR to detect CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-2 group ESBL genes using previously described primers (3, 5). Both isolates were positive only for CTX-M-1 group genes, identified as bla CTX-M-15 after sequencing. Both isolates were obtained at the time of patient admission into the ICU and showed identical pulsed-field gel electro-phoresis patterns (10). Both patients were previously hospital-ized before ICU admission, suggesting that this strain could be endemic in the hospital, where it could be horizontally trans-ferred. All the other E. coli isolates yielded different pulsotypes (data not shown) compared with these. PCR assays for the detection of class 1 integrons and ISCR1 elements were performed according to the method of Di Conza et al. (3). Both isolates carried a class 1 integron con-taining the dfr17 and aadA5 gene cassettes, while ISCR1 ele-ments were not detected. So far we have not been able to transfer these resistance genes, either by transformation or by conjugation. This is the first report of aac(6Ð)-Ib-cr in Uruguay. In accordance with a previous report (6), bla CTX-M-15 and aac(6Ð)-Ib-cr do not seem to be associated with class 1 in-tegrons. Demonstration of a link to IS26 as previously re-ported (1) is pending.

abstract = {Objectives To determine whether the spectrum of mutations in marR in ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of Escherichia coli shows evidence of selection bias, either to reduce fitness costs, or to increase drug resistance. MarR is a repressor protein that regulates, via MarA, expression of the Mar regulon, including the multidrug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC. Methods Isogenic strains carrying 36 different marR alleles identified in resistant clinical isolates, or selected for resistance in vitro, were constructed. Drug susceptibility and relative fitness in growth competition assays were measured for all strains. The expression level of marA, and of various efflux pump components, as a function of specific mutations in marR, was measured by qPCR. Results The spectrum of genetic alterations in marR in clinical isolates is strongly biased against inactivating mutations. In general, the alleles found in clinical isolates conferred a lower level of resistance and imposed a lower growth fitness cost than mutations selected in vitro. The level of expression of MarA correlated well with the MIC of ciprofloxacin. This supports the functional connection between mutations in marR and reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. Conclusions Mutations in marR selected in ciprofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates are strongly biased against inactivating mutations. Selection favours mutant alleles that have the lowest fitness costs, even though these cause only modest reductions in drug susceptibility. This suggests that selection for high relative fitness is more important than selection for increased resistance in determining which alleles of marR will be selected in resistant clinical isolates.},

abstract = {We report here the first gene-encoded resistance mechanism to the swine growth enhancer olaquindox. The genetic elements involved in resistance to olaquindox were subcloned and sequenced from a conjugative plas-mid isolated from Escherichia coli. The subcloned fragment contained two open reading frames, oqxA and oqxB, that are homologous to several resistance-nodulation-cell-division family efflux systems from different species. The putative protein sequences were aligned to both experimentally verified and putative efflux pumps. We show that oqxA and oqxB are expressed in E. coli. Plasmids containing the oqxAB genes yielded high ({\textgreater}128 â®g/ ml) resistance to olaquindox in E. coli, whereas strains containing the control plasmid showed low resistance to the drug (8 â®g/ml). The oqxAB-encoded pump also conferred high ({\textgreater}64 â®g/ml) resistance to chloramphen-icol. We demonstrate that the subcloned fragment conferred H Ø -dependent ethidium efflux abilities to E. coli strain N43. In addition, we show that the efflux system is dependent on the host TolC outer membrane protein when expressed in E. coli. Transfer of multiresistance plasmids is an increasing threat to human health. In recent years, the use of antibiotics as growth enhancers has been the subject of intense debate due to the pos-sibility for selection of drug resistance as a consequence of this practice. The quinoxaline-di-N-oxide olaquindox (OQX) has been a widely used growth enhancer in pigs (3). Its antibiotic activity is due to inhibition of DNA synthesis (19). Curiously, for many years, no genetically encoded resistance to this drug had been isolated. Therefore, it has been considered a relative-ly safe antibiotic. However, S{\o}rensen et al. (17) recently isolat-ed a conjugative plasmid conferring strong resistance to OQX. In short, an OQX-resistant strain of Escherichia coli was iso-lated from swine manure. Plasmid pOLA52, containing the ge-netic determinant for OQX resistance (MIC Ï­ 128 â®g/ml), was subsequently transferred by conjugation from this strain to E. coli CSH26. The size of the plasmid was ca. 52 kb. It also con-fers resistance to ampicillin (AMP; MIC Ï¾ 32 â®g/ml) and chlor-amphenicol (CHL; MIC Ï­ 64 â®g/ml). This raises some con-cern that the use of OQX could select for the proliferation of a conjugative plasmid, which also carries resistance determi-nants for two therapeutic antibiotics, AMP (â¤-lactams) and CHL. We describe here the isolation, subcloning, and sequencing of the plasmid-borne resistance determinant for OQX. Fur-thermore, a mode of action for this resistance mechanism is proposed and validated.},

abstract = {Defined mutations of acrA or acrB (formerly acrE) genes increased the susceptibility of Escherichia coli to a range of small inhibitor molecules. Deletion of acrAB increased susceptibility to cephalothin and cephaloridine, but the permeability of these beta-lactams across the outer membrane was not increased. This finding is inconsistent with the earlier hypothesis that acrAB mutations increase drug susceptibility by increasing the permeability of the outer membrane, and supports our model that acrAB codes for a multi-drug efflux pump. The natural environment of an enteric bacterium such as E. coli is enriched in bile salts and fatty acids. An acrAB deletion mutant was found to be hypersusceptible to bile salts and to decanoate. In addition, acrAB expression was elevated by growth in 5 mM decanoate. These results suggest that one major physiological function of AcrAB is to protect E. coli against these and other hydrophobic inhibitors. Transcription of acrAB is increased by other stress conditions including 4{\%} ethanol, 0.5 M NaCl, and stationary phase in Luria-Bertani medium. Finally, acrAB expression was shown to be increased in mar (multiple-antibiotic-resistant) mutants.},

This event, which requires the SOS-promoting recA and lexA genes as well as dpiA, transiently halts bacterial cell division, enabling survival to otherwise lethal antibiotic exposure.

abstract = {The aim of the current study was to determine the virulence factors, serogroups, and antibiotic resistance properties of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli isolated from chicken meat samples. A total of 422 chicken meat samples were collected from 5 townships of Iran. Specimens were immediately transferred to the laboratory in a cooler with an ice pack. Samples were cultured, and the positive culture samples were analyzed by PCR assays. Finally, the antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed using the disk diffusion method in Mueller-Hinton agar. According to the results, out of 422 samples, 146 (34.59{\%}) were confirmed to be E. coli positive and among E. coli-positive samples, 51 (34.93{\%}) and 31 (21.23{\%}) were from attaching and effacing E. coli (AEEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) subgroups, respectively. All of the EHEC-positive samples had all stx1, eaeA, and ehly virulence genes, whereas only 5 (9.80{\%}) of AEEC subgroup had all stx1, stx2, and eaeA genes. As the data revealed, O157 was the most prevalent and O111 was the least prevalent strains in the Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) population. Among STEC strains, sulI and blaSHV had the highest and lowest incidence rate, respectively. There was a high resistance to tetracycline (76.82{\%}), followed by chloramphenicol (73.17{\%}) and nitrofurantoin (63.41{\%}), but there was low resistance to cephalotine (7.31{\%}) antibiotics in isolated strains. Results shows that the PCR technique has a high performance for detection of serogroups, virulence genes, and antibiotic resistance genes in STEC strains. This study is the first prevalence report of detection of virulence genes, serogroups, and antibiotic resistance properties of STEC strains isolated from chicken meat samples in Iran. Based on the results, chicken meat is one of the main sources of STEC strains and its virulence factors in Iran, so an accurate meat inspection would reduce disease outbreaks.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli K-12 strains are normally tolerant to n-hexane and susceptible to cyclohexane. Constitutive expression of marA of the multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) locus or of the soxS or robA gene product produced tolerance to cyclohexane. Inactivation of the mar locus or the robA locus, but not the soxRS locus, increased organic solvent susceptibility in the wild type and Mar mutants (to both n-hexane and cyclohexane). The organic solvent hypersusceptibility is a newly described phenotype for a robA-inactivated strain. Multicopy expression of mar, soxS, or robA induced cyclohexane tolerance in strains with a deleted or inactivated chromosomal mar, soxRS, or robA locus; thus, each transcriptional activator acts independently of the others. However, in a strain with 39 kb of chromosomal DNA, including the mar locus, deleted, only the multicopy complete mar locus, consisting of its two operons, produced cyclohexane tolerance. Deletion of acrAB from either wild-type E. coli K-12 or a Mar mutant resulted in loss of tolerance to both n-hexane and cyclohexane. Organic solvent tolerance mediated by mar, soxS, or robA was not restored in strains with acrAB deleted. These findings strongly suggest that active efflux specified by the acrAB locus is linked to intrinsic organic solvent tolerance and to tolerance mediated by the marA, soxS, or robA gene product in E. coli.},

abstract = {Antibiotic drug-target interactions, and their respective direct effects, are generally well characterized. By contrast, the bacterial responses to antibiotic drug treatments that contribute to cell death are not as well understood and have proven to be complex as they involve many genetic and biochemical pathways. In this Review, we discuss the multilayered effects of drug-target interactions, including the essential cellular processes that are inhibited by bactericidal antibiotics and the associated cellular response mechanisms that contribute to killing. We also discuss new insights into these mechanisms that have been revealed through the study of biological networks, and describe how these insights, together with related developments in synthetic biology, could be exploited to create new antibacterial therapies.},

abstract = {Cloacal swabs from carcasses of Dutch wild birds obtained in 2010 and 2011 were selectively cultured on media with cefotaxime to screen for the presence of extended-spectrum $\beta$-lactamase (ESBL)/AmpC-producing Escherichia coli. Subsequently, all cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates were tested by broth microdilution and microarray. The presence of ESBL/AmpC and coexisting plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. To determine the size of plasmids and the location of ESBL and PMQR genes, S1 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on transformants, followed by Southern blot hybridization. The study included 414 cloacal swabs originating from 55 different bird species. Cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates were identified in 65 birds (15.7{\%}) from 21 different species. In all, 65 cefotaxime-resistant E. coli ESBL/AmpC genes were detected, mainly comprising variants of blaCTX-M and blaCMY-2. Furthermore, PMQR genes [aac(6')-lb-cr, qnrB1, and qnrS1] coincided in seven cefotaxime-resistant E. coli isolates. Overall, replicon typing of the ESBL/AmpC-carrying plasmids demonstrated the predominant presence of IncI1 (n = 31) and variants of IncF (n = 18). Our results indicate a wide dissemination of ESBL and AmpC genes in wild birds from The Netherlands, especially among aquatic-associated species (waterfowl, gulls, and waders). The identified genes and plasmids reflect the genes found predominantly in livestock animals as well as in humans.},

abstract = {Outbreaks of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) linked to dry-fermented sausages (DFSs) have emphasized the need for DFS manufacturers to introduce measures to obtain enhanced safety and still maintain the sensory qualities of their products. To our knowledge no data have yet been reported on non-O157:H7 VTEC survival in DFS. Here, the importance of recipe and process variables on VTEC (O157:H7 and O103:H25) reductions in two types of DFS, morr and salami, was determined through three statistically designed experiments. Linear regression and ANOVA analyses showed that no single variable had a dominant effect on VTEC reductions. High levels of NaCl, NaNO(2), glucose (low pH) and fermentation temperature gave enhanced VTEC reduction, while high fat and large casing diameter (a(w)) gave the opposite effect. Interaction effects were small. The process and recipe variables showed similar effects in morr and salami. In general, recipes combining high batter levels of salt (NaCl and NaNO(2)) and glucose along with high fermentation temperature that gave DFS with low final pH and a(w), provided approximately 3 log(10) reductions compared to approximately 1.5 log(10) reductions obtained for standard recipe DFS. Storage at 4 degrees C for 2 months provided log(10) 0.33-0.95 additional VTEC reductions and were only marginally affected by recipe type. Sensory tests revealed only small differences between the various recipes of morr and salami. By optimisation of recipe and process parameters, it is possible to obtain increased microbial safety of DFS while maintaining the sensory qualities of the sausages.},

abstract = {Antibiotics have always been considered one of the wonder discoveries of the 20th century. This is true, but the real wonder is the rise of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, communities, and the environment concomitant with their use. The extraordinary genetic capacities of microbes have benefitted from man's overuse of antibiotics to exploit every source of resistance genes and every means of horizontal gene transmission to develop multiple mechanisms of resistance for each and every antibiotic introduced into practice clinically, agriculturally, or otherwise. This review presents the salient aspects of antibiotic resistance development over the past half-century, with the oft-restated conclusion that it is time to act. To achieve complete restitution of therapeutic applications of antibiotics, there is a need for more information on the role of environmental microbiomes in the rise of antibiotic resistance. In particular, creative approaches to the discovery of novel antibiotics and their expedited and controlled introduction to therapy are obligatory.},

The isolates originated from chicken in the production pyramid, healthy food-producing animals at slaughter (chicken, calves, and pigs), chicken retail meat, environmental isolates originating from water bodies, and isolates from humans. A selection of IncI and IncN plasmids were characterized by multilocus sequence typing in order to determine their epidemiological relatedness. METHODS: Transconjugants of 74 bla CTX-M-1-positive isolates were analyzed by PCR-based replicon typing and by PCR-based plasmid multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: The incompatibility groups detected among the bla CTX-M-1-harboring plasmids included IncI1, IncN, IncHI1B, IncF, IncFIIS, IncFIB, and IncB/O, with plasmid lineage IncI1/ST3 predominating in isolates from chicken and from humans. Lineage IncN/ST1 was detected mainly in isolates from pigs. For the first time, bla CTX-M-1 genes encoded on IncHI1 plasmids were detected in isolates from cattle and from water bodies. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies plasmid lineages that are contributing to the dissemination of bla CTX-M-1 genes in the food chain, the environment, and humans.},

abstract = {Introduction: Fluoroquinolones are important antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli. Mutational studies have shown that ciprofloxacin, a member of fluoroquinolones induces SOS response and mutagenesis in pathogenic bacteria which in turn develop antibiotic resistance. However, inhibition of SOS response can increase recombination activity which in turn leads to genetic variation. Objective: The aim of this study was to measure 5 SOS genes expressions in nine E. coli mutants with different MICs for ciprofloxacin following exposure to ciprofloxacin. Methods: Gene expression was assessed by quantitative real time PCR. Gene alteration assessment was conducted by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Results: Results showed that the expression of recA was increased in 5 mutants. This overexpression is not related to gene alteration, and enhances the expression of polB and umuCD genes encoding nonmutagenic and mutagenic polymerases, respectively. The direct relationship between the level of SOS expression and the level of resistance to ciprofloxacin was also indicated. Conclusion: It was concluded that novel therapeutic strategy that inhibits RecA activity would enhance the efficiency of common antibiotics against pathogenic bacteria.},

abstract = {Mar (multiple antibiotic resistant) mutants of Escherichia coli express chromosomally mediated resistance to a variety of structurally unrelated hydrophilic and hydrophobic antibiotics. Insertion of transposon Tn5 into the marA locus at min 34.05 on the chromosome completely reverses the Mar phenotype (A. M. George and S. B. Levy, J. Bacteriol. 155:531-540, 1983). We found that among changes in the outer membrane of Mar mutants, porin OmpF was greatly reduced, although Mar mutants were more resistant than cells lacking only OmpF. Transduction of the marA region from a Mar strain, but not a wild-type strain, led to loss of OmpF. P1 transduction of marA::Tn5 into a Mar mutant partially restored OmpF levels. Therefore, OmpF reduction required a mutation in the marA region. Mar mutants of an ompF-lacZ operon fusion strain expressed 50 to 75{\%} of the beta-galactosidase activity of the isogenic non-Mar parental strain, while Mar mutants of a protein fusion strain expressed less than 10{\%} of the enzyme activity in the non-Mar strain. These changes were completely reversed by insertion of marA::Tn5. The responsiveness of OmpF-LacZ to osmolarity and temperature changes was similar in Mar and wild-type strains. Although some transcriptional control may have been present, OmpF reduction appeared to occur primarily by a posttranscriptional mechanism. The steady-state levels of ompF mRNA were twofold lower and the mRNA was five times less stable in the Mar mutant than in the wild-type strain. Expression of micF, which lowers ompF mRNA levels, was elevated in Mar strains, as revealed by a micF-lacZ fusion. Studies with strains deleted for the micF locus showed that the marA-dependent reduction of OmpF required an intact micF locus. Our findings suggest that the marA locus directly or indirectly increases micF expression, causing a posttranscriptional decrease in ompF mRNA and reduced amounts of OmpF.},

Testing of Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations revealed 6.4{\%} of 2680 isolates conferring ciprofloxacin resistance. Simultaneously 37.7{\%} and 40.8{\%} were accounted for, respectively, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin Non Wild-Type populations. Amplification and sequencing of quinolone resistance determining region of topoisomerases genes in 44 isolates identified multiple amino-acid substitutions in gyrA at positions Ser83 (N= 22; ???Leu, ???Phe, ???Tyr), Asp87 (N= 22; ???Asn, ???Gly, ???Tyr) and parC (Thr57Ser, N= 23; Ala141Ser, N= 1). No relevant mutations were identified in gyrB and parE. Twelve patterns combining one or two substitutions were related to neither serovar nor ciprofloxacin MIC. In 92 isolates suspected for plasmid mediated quinolone resistance two qnr alleles were found: qnrS1 (or qnrS3; N= 50) and qnrB19 (or qnrB10; N= 24). Additionally, two isolates with chromosomally encoded mechanisms carried qnrS1 and qnrS2. All tested isolates were negative for qnrA, qnrC, qnrD, qepA, aac(6'.)-Ib-cr. Both chromosomal and plasmid mediated quinolone resistance determinants were found in several Salmonella serovars and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis was used to assess phylogenetic similarity of selected isolates (N= 82). Salmonella Newport was found to accumulate quinolone resistance determinants and the serovar was spreading clonally with either variable gyrA mutations, qnrS1/S3, or qnrB10/B19. Alternatively, various determinants are dispersed among related S. Enteritidis isolates. Antimicrobial selection pressure, multiple resistance determinants and scenarios for their acquisition and spread make extremely difficult to combat quinolone resistance. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Since 2000, Escherichia coli producing CTX-M enzymes have emerged worldwide as important causes of community-onset urinary tract and bloodstream infections owing to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria. Molecular epidemiological studies suggested that the sudden worldwide increase of CTX-M-15-producing E. coli was mainly due to a single clone (ST131) and that foreign travel to high-risk areas, such as the Indian subcontinent, might in part play a role in the spread of this clone across different continents. Empirical antibiotic coverage for these resistant organisms should be considered in community patients presenting with sepsis involving the urinary tract, especially if the patient recently travelled to a high-risk area. If this emerging public health threat is ignored, it is possible that the medical community may be forced, in the near future, to use carbapenems as the first choice for the empirical treatment of serious infections associated with urinary tract infections originating from the community.},

abstract = {Mutations in loci other than genes for the target topoisomerases of fluoroquinolones, gyrA and parC, may play a role in the development of fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia coli. A series of mutants with increasing resistance to ofloxacin was obtained from an E. coli K-12 strain and five clinical isolates. First-step mutants acquired a gyrA mutation. Second-step mutants reproducibly acquired a phenotype of multiple antibiotic resistance (Mar) and organic solvent tolerance and showed enhanced fluoroquinolone efflux. None of the second-step mutants showed additional topoisomerase mutations. All second-step mutants showed constitutive expression of marA and/or overexpressed soxS. In some third-step mutants, fluoroquinolone efflux was further enhanced compared to that for second-step mutants, even when the mutant had acquired additional topoisomerase mutations. Attempts to circumvent the second-step Mar mutation by induction of the mar locus with sodium salicylate and thus to select for pure topoisomerase mutants at the second step were not successful. At least in vitro, non-target gene mutations accumulate in second- and third-step mutants upon exposure to a fluoroquinolone and typically include, but do not appear to be limited to, mutations in the mar or sox regulons with consequent increased drug efflux.},

abstract = {The primary objective of this study was to investigate calf and farm factors associated with antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli in the feces of preweaned dairy calves in Sweden. In particular, we investigated the effects of feeding calves colostrum and milk from cows treated with antimicrobials. The secondary objective was to describe the prevalence of resistant E. coli in feces of preweaned dairy calves in Sweden. Fecal samples from 3 calves, aged 7 to 28d, from 243 farms were analyzed for the within-sample prevalence of E. coli resistant to nalidixic acid, streptomycin, and cefotaxime using selective agars supplemented with antimicrobials. In addition, resistance to 12 antimicrobials was tested in one randomly selected E. coli isolate per calf. Information was collected from the farmers via questionnaires regarding the use of colostrum and milk from cows treated with antimicrobials as calf feed and other uses of antimicrobials in the herd. Multivariable zero-inflated negative binomial and logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of various risk factors for shedding of resistant E. coli. Escherichia coli resistant to streptomycin, nalidixic acid, or cefotaxime were isolated from 90, 49, and 11{\%} of the calves, respectively. Resistance to at least one antimicrobial was found in a random isolate of E. coli from 48{\%} of the calves. Feeding colostrum from cows treated with antimicrobials at drying off did not affect the prevalence of resistant E. coli. In contrast, feeding milk from cows treated with antimicrobials during lactation resulted in significantly more nalidixic acid- and streptomycin-resistant E. coli than when such milk was discarded; no significant effect was seen for other resistance traits. Furthermore, an interaction was found between feeding milk from cows treated with antimicrobials and use of fluoroquinolones in cows. In general, the prevalence of resistance was lower for older calves and calves on small farms. Other factors that were associated with the shedding of resistant E. coli were administration of oral dihydrostreptomycin to calves, administration of systemic tetracycline and ceftiofur to cows and calves, housing of the calves, predominant breed of the herd, and geographic location of the farm. The presence of resistant E. coli in calves was clearly due to multiple factors, but minimizing the feeding of milk from cows treated with antimicrobials during lactation should lower the prevalence of resistant E. coli in the gastrointestinal tract of the calves.},

abstract = {Observational studies are prone to two types of errors: random and systematic. Random error arises as a result of variation between samples that might be drawn in a study and can be reduced by increasing the sample size. Systematic error arises from problems with the study design or the methods used to obtain the study data and is not influenced by sample size. Over the last 20 years, veterinary epidemiologists have made great progress in dealing more effectively with random error (particularly through the use of multilevel models) but paid relatively little attention to systematic error. Systematic errors can arise from unmeasured confounders, selection bias and information bias. Unmeasured confounders include both factors which are known to be confounders but which were not measured in a study and factors which are not known to be confounders. Confounders can bias results toward or away from the null. The impact of selection bias can also be difficult to predict and can be negligible or large. Although the direction of information bias is generally toward the null, this cannot be guaranteed and its impact might be very large. Methods of dealing with systematic errors include: qualitative assessment, quantitative bias analysis and incorporation of bias parameters into the statistical analyses.},

abstract = {Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) -producing Enterobacteriaceae have been notifiable according to the Swedish Communicable Disease Act since 2007. A major increase in the number of cases has been observed, with 2099 cases in 2007 and 7225 cases in 2012. The majority of the isolates are Escherichia coli. Additionally, Swedish data on the prevalence of ESBL-producing invasive isolates of E. coli are available through EARS-Net, and through biannual point prevalence studies, where molecular characterization of isolates from the entire country is carried out. This paper describes major trends in the Swedish epidemiology of ESBL-producing E. coli in the period 2007-2012. Isolates from the point prevalence studies were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, ESBL genotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multi-locus sequence typing and phylogenetic grouping with PCR. The distribution of sequence types, resistance genes and susceptibility levels were all stable over the three study periods. The dominating resistance gene conferring ESBL was blaCTX -M-15 , found in 54-58{\%} of the isolates. ST131 represented 34-38{\%} of the isolates. Other major sequence types were ST38, ST69, ST405, ST617 and ST648, each representing 2-6{\%} of the isolates. Phylogenetic group B2 was the most common, and was observed in 41-47{\%} of the isolates. However, among ST131 isolates the B2 phylogenetic group represented 90-98{\%} of the isolates. The most important epidemiological difference seen over time was that the median age of infected women decreased from 62 to 52 years (p {\textless}0.0001) and infected men from 67 to 64 years. A potential explanation might be the shift towards a higher proportion of community-acquired infections in individuals lacking comorbidities.},

abstract = {SignificanceKlebsiella pneumoniae is rapidly becoming untreatable using last-line antibiotics. It is especially problematic in hospitals, where it causes a range of acute infections. To approach controlling such a bacterium, we first must define what it is and how it varies genetically. Here we have determined the DNA sequence of K. pneumoniae isolates from around the world and present a detailed analysis of these data. We show that there is a wide spectrum of diversity, including variation within shared sequences and gain and loss of whole genes. Using this detailed blueprint, we show that there is an unrecognized association between the possession of specific gene profiles associated with virulence and antibiotic resistance and the differing disease outcomes seen for K. pneumoniae. Klebsiella pneumoniae is now recognized as an urgent threat to human health because of the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains associated with hospital outbreaks and hypervirulent strains associated with severe community-acquired infections. K. pneumoniae is ubiquitous in the environment and can colonize and infect both plants and animals. However, little is known about the population structure of K. pneumoniae, so it is difficult to recognize or understand the emergence of clinically important clones within this highly genetically diverse species. Here we present a detailed genomic framework for K. pneumoniae based on whole-genome sequencing of more than 300 human and animal isolates spanning four continents. Our data provide genome-wide support for the splitting of K. pneumoniae into three distinct species, KpI (K. pneumoniae), KpII (K. quasipneumoniae), and KpIII (K. variicola). Further, for K. pneumoniae (KpI), the entity most frequently associated with human infection, we show the existence of {\textgreater}150 deeply branching lineages including numerous multidrug-resistant or hypervirulent clones. We show K. pneumoniae has a large accessory genome approaching 30,000 protein-coding genes, including a number of virulence functions that are significantly associated with invasive community-acquired disease in humans. In our dataset, antimicrobial resistance genes were common among human carriage isolates and hospital-acquired infections, which generally lacked the genes associated with invasive disease. The convergence of virulence and resistance genes potentially could lead to the emergence of untreatable invasive K. pneumoniae infections; our data provide the whole-genome framework against which to track the emergence of such threats.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare and characterize extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli from pigsties, pig farmers and their families on farms with previous high or no use of third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins. METHODS: Twenty farms with no third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin use and 19 herds with previous frequent use were included. The ESBL-producing isolates detected in humans and pigs were characterized by ESBL genotype, PFGE, susceptibility to non-beta-lactam antibiotics and phylotype, and selected isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Furthermore, transferability of blaCTX-M-1 from both human and pig isolates was studied and plasmid incompatibility groups were defined. The volunteers answered a questionnaire including epidemiological risk factors for carriage of ESBL-producing E. coli. RESULTS: ESBL-producing E. coli was detected in pigs on 79{\%} of the farms with high consumption of cephalosporins compared with 20{\%} of the pigs on farms with no consumption. ESBL-producing E. coli was detected in 19 of the 195 human participants and all but one had contact with pigs. The genes found in both humans and pigs at the same farms were blaCTX-M-1 (eight farms), blaCTX-M-14 (one farm) and blaSHV-12 (one farm). At four farms ESBL-producing E. coli isolates with the same CTX-M enzyme, phylotype, PFGE type and MLST type were detected in both pigs and farmers. The majority of the plasmids with blaCTX-M-1 were transferable by conjugation and belonged to incompatibility group IncI1, IncF, or IncN. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows an increased frequency of ESBL-producing E. coli on farms with high consumption of third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins and indicates transfer of either ESBL-producing E. coli or plasmids between pigs and farmers.},

abstract = {Beta-lactamases continue to be the leading cause of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics among gram-negative bacteria. In recent years there has been an increased incidence and prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), enzymes that hydrolyze and cause resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and aztreonam. The majority of ESBLs are derived from the widespread broad-spectrum beta-lactamases TEM-1 and SHV-1. There are also new families of ESBLs, including the CTX-M and OXA-type enzymes as well as novel, unrelated beta-lactamases. Several different methods for the detection of ESBLs in clinical isolates have been suggested. While each of the tests has merit, none of the tests is able to detect all of the ESBLs encountered. ESBLs have become widespread throughout the world and are now found in a significant percentage of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in certain countries. They have also been found in other Enterobacteriaceae strains and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains expressing these beta-lactamases will present a host of therapeutic challenges as we head into the 21st century.},

abstract = {Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have been increasingly reported in Europe since their first description in 1983. During the 1990s, they were described mainly as members of the TEM- and SHV-beta-lactamase families in Klebsiella pneumoniae causing nosocomial outbreaks. Nowadays, they are mostly found in Escherichia coli that cause community-acquired infections and with increasing frequency contain CTX-M enzymes. Dissemination of specific clones or clonal groups and epidemic plasmids in community and nosocomial settings has been the main reason for the increase in most of the widespread ESBLs belonging to the TEM (TEM-24, TEM-4, TEM-52), SHV (SHV-5, SHV-12) and CTX-M (CTX-M-9, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-14 or CTX-M-15) families in Europe. Co-selection with other resistances, especially to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and sulfonamides, seems to have contributed to the problem. The emergence of epidemic clones harbouring several beta-lactamases simultaneously (ESBLs, metallo-beta-lactamases or cephamycinases) and of new mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides warrants future surveillance studies.},

abstract = {We have previously reported that supplementation of exogenous glutathione (GSH) promotes ciprofloxacin resistance in Escherichia coli by neutralizing antibiotic-induced oxidative stress and by enhancing the efflux of antibiotic. In the present study, we used a whole-genome microarray as a tool to analyze the system-level transcriptomic changes of E. coli on exposure to GSH and/or ciprofloxacin. The microarray data revealed that GSH supplementation affects redox function, transport, acid shock, and virulence genes of E. coli . The data further highlighted the interplay of multiple underlying stress response pathways (including those associated with the genes mentioned above and DNA damage repair genes) at the core of GSH, offsetting the effect of ciprofloxacin in E. coli . The results of a large-scale validation of the transcriptomic data using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis for 40 different genes were mostly in agreement with the microarray results. The altered growth profiles of 12 different E. coli strains carrying deletions in the specific genes mentioned above with GSH and/or ciprofloxacin supplementation implicate these genes in the GSH-mediated phenotype not only at the molecular level but also at the functional level. We further associated GSH supplementation with increased acid shock survival of E. coli on the basis of our transcriptomic data. Taking the data together, it can be concluded that GSH supplementation influences the expression of genes of multiple stress response pathways apart from its effect(s) at the physiological level to counter the action of ciprofloxacin in E. coli .},

abstract = {Nearly 40 years ago, Dr. R.J. Gibbons made the first reports of the clinical relevance of what we now know as bacterial biofilms when he published his observations of the role of polysaccharide glycocalyx formation on teeth by Streptococcus mutans [Sci. Am. 238 (1978) 86]. As the clinical relevance of bacterial biofilm formation became increasingly apparent, interest in the phenomenon exploded. Studies are rapidly shedding light on the biomolecular pathways leading to this sessile mode of growth but many fundamental questions remain. The intent of this review is to consider the reasons why bacteria switch from a free-floating to a biofilm mode of growth. The currently available wealth of data pertaining to the molecular genetics of biofilm formation in commonly studied, clinically relevant, single-species biofilms will be discussed in an effort to decipher the motivation behind the transition from planktonic to sessile growth in the human body. Four potential incentives behind the formation of biofilms by bacteria during infection are considered: (1) protection from harmful conditions in the host (defense), (2) sequestration to a nutrient-rich area (colonization), (3) utilization of cooperative benefits (community), (4) biofilms normally grow as biofilms and planktonic cultures are an in vitro artifact (biofilms as the default mode of growth).},

abstract = {Toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are small genetic elements composed of a toxin gene and its cognate antitoxin. The toxins of all known TA systems are proteins while the antitoxins are either proteins or non-coding RNAs. Based on the molecular nature of the antitoxin and its mode of interaction with the toxin the TA modules are currently grouped into five classes. In general, the toxin is more stable than the antitoxin but the latter is expressed to a higher level. If supply of the antitoxin stops, for instance under special growth conditions or by plasmid loss in case of plasmid encoded TA systems, the antitoxin is rapidly degraded and can no longer counteract the toxin. Consequently, the toxin becomes activated and can act on its cellular targets. Typically, TA toxins act on crucial cellular processes including translation, replication, cytoskeleton formation, membrane integrity, and cell wall biosynthesis. TA systems and their components are also versatile tools for a multitude of purposes in basic research and biotechnology. Currently, TA systems are frequently used for selection in cloning and for single protein expression in living bacterial cells. Since several TA toxins exhibit activity in yeast and mammalian cells they may be useful for applications in eukaryotic systems. TA modules are also considered as promising targets for the development of antibacterial drugs and their potential to combat viral infection may aid in controlling infectious diseases.},

@article{Drlica1997,
abstract = {For many years, DNA gyrase was thought to be responsible both for unlinking replicated daughter chromosomes and for controlling negative superhelical tension in bacterial DNA. However, in 1990 a homolog of gyrase, topoisomerase IV, that had a potent decatenating activity was discovered. It is now clear that topoisomerase IV, rather than gyrase, is responsible for decatenation of interlinked chromosomes. Moreover, topoisomerase IV is a target of the 4-quinolones, antibacterial agents that had previously been thought to target only gyrase. The key event in quinolone action is reversible trapping of gyrase-DNA and topoisomerase IV-DNA complexes. Complex formation with gyrase is followed by a rapid, reversible inhibition of DNA synthesis, cessation of growth, and induction of the SOS response. At higher drug concentrations, cell death occurs as double-strand DNA breaks are released from trapped gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV complexes. Repair of quinolone-induced DNA damage occurs largely via recombination pathways. In many gram-negative bacteria, resistance to moderate levels of quinolone arises from mutation of the gyrase A protein and resistance to high levels of quinolone arises from mutation of a second gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV site. For some gram-positive bacteria, the situation is reversed: primary resistance occurs through changes in topoisomerase IV while gyrase changes give additional resistance. Gyrase is also trapped on DNA by lethal gene products of certain large, low-copy-number plasmids. Thus, quinolone-topoisomerase biology is providing a model for understanding aspects of host-parasite interactions and providing ways to investigate manipulation of the bacterial chromosome by topoisomerases.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is often the result of mutations that block drug activity; however, bacteria also evade antibiotics by transiently expressing genes such as multidrug efflux pumps. A crucial question is whether transient resistance can promote permanent genetic changes. Previous studies have established that antibiotic treatment can select tolerant cells that then mutate to achieve permanent resistance. Whether these mutations result from antibiotic stress or preexist within the population is unclear. To address this question, we focused on the multidrug pump AcrAB-TolC. Using time-lapse microscopy, we found that cells with higher acrAB expression have lower expression of the DNA mismatch repair gene mutS , lower growth rates, and higher mutation frequencies. Thus, transient antibiotic resistance from elevated acrAB expression can promote spontaneous mutations within single cells.},

abstract = {The soxRS regulon of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica is induced by redox-cycling compounds or nitric oxide and provides resistance to superoxide-generating agents, macrophage-generated nitric oxide, antibiotics, and organic solvents. We have previously shown that constitutive expression of soxRS can contribute to quinolone resistance in clinically relevant S. enterica. In this work, we have carried out an analysis of the mechanism of constitutive soxS expression and its role in antibiotic resistance in E. coli clinical isolates. We show that constitutive soxS expression in three out of six strains was caused by single point mutations in the soxR gene. The mutant SoxR proteins contributed to the multiple-antibiotic resistance phenotypes of the clinical strains and were sufficient to confer multiple-antibiotic resistance in a fresh genetic background. In the other three clinical isolates, we observed, for the first time, that elevated soxS expression was not due to mutations in soxR. The mechanism of such increased soxS expression remains unclear. The same E. coli clinical isolates harbored polymorphic soxR and soxS DNA sequences, also seen for the first time.},

abstract = {To evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in broiler chickens, 41 rectal samples taken from four commercial farms were examined. Desoxycholate hydrogen sulfide lactose agars,supplemented with either 4 mug/ml cefotaxime or 16 mug/ml ceftazidime, were used to screen ESC-resistant bacteria. ESC-resistant bacteria were isolated from all samples. Of the 164 ESC-resistant bacteria(included four isolates per a sample), 163 were Escherichia coli, while one isolate was identified as Enterobacter cloacae. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase genes in the isolates were determined by PCR and sequencing. One AmpC beta-lactamase gene, blaCMY-2 (66{\%}), and four ESBL genes, blaCTX-M-1 (26{\%}), blaCTX-M-55 (10{\%}), blaSHV-5 (4{\%}) and blaCTX-M-2 (3{\%}), were detected in the E. coli isolates.The epidemiological relationship of the CMY-2 and CTX-M beta-lactamase-producing isolates among the farms was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis using the XbaI restriction enzyme. Forty-one (Y1-Y41) and 14 (X1-X14) clusters were found in the CMY-2 and CTX-M-carrying E. coli isolates, respectively. Some clusters included isolates derived from more than one farm, indicating some cross-contamination of clonal strains, and spread of CMY-2 AmpC beta-lactamase or CTX-M ESBL among the farms.},

abstract = {Drug discovery research in the area of infectious diseases, in particular that dealing with antibacterial/antibiotic susceptibility and resistance, is in a process of continuing evolution. Steeped in the history of the highly successful intervention with chemotherapeutic agents to treat human infections, the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens worldwide presents a serious unmet medical need, if not a pending catastrophe. Research in both academia and industry over the past 30 years using molecular biology, genetics and more recently - bacterial genomics - has assembled key enabling technologies to increase productivity and success rates in the discovery and development of novel antibacterial agents. However genomics is not limited only to antibacterial target selection but provides the opportunity to further understand key interactions in the use of antibacterial compounds as therapeutic agents (such as resistance emergence, susceptibility, efflux, interactions between compound and pathogen, etc.). Genomics also offers the potential for insights into: bacterial niche adaptation, host susceptibility, treatment regimens, antibiotic resistance, pharmacokinetics (e.g., host metabolism differences), safety and the microbial genesis of chronic diseases (e.g., gastric ulceration). ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Despite the fact that the first genomes sequenced of free living organisms were those of bacteria, there have been few specialized bioinformatic tools developed to mine the growing amount of genomic data associated with pathogens. In particular, there are few tools to study the genetics and genomics of antibiotic resistance and how it impacts bacterial populations, ecology, and the clinic. We have initiated development of such tools in the form of the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database (CARD; http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca). The CARD integrates disparate molecular and sequence data, provides a unique organizing principle in the form of the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), and can quickly identify putative antibiotic resistance genes in new unannotated genome sequences. This unique platform provides an informatic tool that bridges antibiotic resistance concerns in health care, agriculture, and the environment.},

A prominent site of action is shown to be located at a distance of about 80 bp from the hisG428 sequence at which mutations are scored in the responsive strain TA102. Since the interaction of quinolones with the mammalian counterpart of gyrase, topoisomerase II, is lower by orders of magnitude, it is argued that the bacterial screening tests are of little relevance for predicting effects in mammalian cells. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {RAxML-VI-HPC (randomized axelerated maximum likelihood for high performance computing) is a sequential and parallel program for inference of large phylogenies with maximum likelihood (ML). Low-level technical optimizations, a modification of the search algorithm, and the use of the GTR+CAT approximation as replacement for GTR+Gamma yield a program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the previous version of RAxML. A large-scale performance comparison with GARLI, PHYML, IQPNNI and MrBayes on real data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that RAxML requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing program (GARLI) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets {\textgreater} or =4000 taxa it also runs 2-3 times faster than GARLI. RAxML has been parallelized with MPI to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting trees. The program has been used to compute ML trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25,057 (1463 bp) and 2182 (51,089 bp) taxa, respectively.

abstract = {Antibiotic consumption and population density as a measure of crowding in the community were related to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance of three cities in three different countries: St Johns in Newfoundland (Canada), Athens in Greece and Groningen in The Netherlands. Antibiotic consumption was expressed in DDD (defined daily dose), as DID (DDD/1000 inhabitants/day) and as DSD (DDD/km(2)). The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli and enterococci was determined in faecal samples of healthy volunteers. In both Newfoundland (28 DID) and Greece (29 DID) the overall consumption of antibiotics was more than three times higher compared with that of The Netherlands (9 DID). The lowest prevalence of resistant E. coli against the majority of antibiotics tested was found for the samples from Newfoundland and was significant (P {\textless} 0.05) for cefazolin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim. A poor correlation between the number of DID and the prevalence of resistance was observed [the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pcc) ranged between -0.93 and 0.87]. However, when population density was taken into consideration and antibiotic consumption was expressed in DSD, a strong correlation was observed (and Pcc ranged between 0.86 and 1.00). This study suggests that population density is an important factor in the development of antibiotic resistance and warrants special attention as a factor in resistance epidemiology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Commensal bacteria are a reservoir for antimicrobial-resistance genes. In the Netherlands, bacteria producing Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL) are found on chicken-meat and in the gut of broilers at a high prevalence and the predominant ESBL-gene is the bla(CTX-M-1) located on IncI1 plasmids. We aim to determine the fitness costs of this plasmid for the bacterium.We investigated the conjugation dynamics of IncI1 plasmids carrying the bla(CTX-M-1) gene in a batch culture and its impact on the population dynamics of three E. coli populations: donors, recipients and transconjugants. The intrinsic growth rate (psi), maximum density (K) and lag-phase (lambda) of the populations were estimated as well as the conjugation coefficient. Loss of the plasmid by transconjugants was either assumed constant or depended on the effective growth rate of the transconjugants.Parameters were estimated from experiments with pure culture of donors, recipients and transconjugants and with mixed culture of donors and recipients with a duration of 24 or 48 hours. Extrapolation of the results was compared to a 3-months experiment in which a mixed culture of recipient and transconjugant was regularly diluted in new medium. RESULTS: No differences in estimated growth parameters (psi, K or lambda) were found between donor, recipient and transconjugant, and plasmid loss was not observed. The conjugation coefficient of transconjugants was 104 times larger than that of the donor. In the 3-months experiment, the proportion of transconjugants did not decrease, indicating no or very small fitness costs. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro the IncI1 plasmid carrying the blaCTX-M-1 gene imposes no or negligible fitness costs on its E. coli host, and persists without antimicrobial usage.},

abstract = {Bacteria contain a number of error prevention and error correction systems that maintain genome stability. However, strains exhibiting elevated mutation frequencies have recently been reported amongst natural populations of pathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria meningitidis, Helicobacter pylori and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The majority of naturally occurring, strong mutators contain defects in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, with mutations in mutS predominating. MMR-deficient strains possess superior genetic backgrounds for the selection of some antibiotic-resistance mutations since mutation frequencies up to 1000-fold higher than normal strains have been reported, and resistance levels achieved in mutators can be greater than those arising in non-mutator hosts. MMR is a major constraint to interspecies recombination events. Removal of this barrier, as in the case of MMR defective mutators, also enhances the frequency of horizontal gene transfer, which is an important mechanism of acquired drug resistance in bacteria. Permanent global mutator status is associated with loss of fitness as mutators accumulate deleterious mutations more frequently than non-mutators. Fitness limitations of mutators may be overcome simply by the high bacterial cell densities that can be achieved during acute infection or by the adoption of transient mutator status. Mutators are a risk factor during the treatment of bacterial infections as they appear to enhance the selection of mutants expressing high- and low-level antibiotic resistance and have the capacity to refine existing plasmid-located resistance determinants. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Fluoroquinolones are broad-spectrum antimicrobials highly effective for treatment of a variety of clinical and veterinary infections. Their antibacterial activity is due to inhibition of DNA replication. Usually resistance arises spontaneously due to point mutations that result in amino acid substitutions within the topoisomerase subunits GyrA, GyrB, ParC or ParE, decreased expression of outer membrane porins, or overexpression of multidrug efflux pumps. In addition, the recent discovery of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance could result in horizontal transfer of fluoroquinolone resistance between strains. Acquisition of high-level resistance appears to be a multifactorial process. Care needs to taken to avoid overuse of this important class of antimicrobial in both human and veterinary medicine to prevent an increase in the occurrence of resistant zoonotic and non-zoonotic bacterial pathogens that could subsequently cause human or animal infections.},

abstract = {Antimicrobials are valuable therapeutics whose efficacy is seriously compromised by the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. The provision of antibiotics to food animals encompasses a wide variety of nontherapeutic purposes that include growth promotion. The concern over resistance emergence and spread to people by nontherapeutic use of antimicrobials has led to conflicted practices and opinions. Considerable evidence supported the removal of nontherapeutic antimicrobials (NTAs) in Europe, based on the "precautionary principle." Still, concrete scientific evidence of the favorable versus unfavorable consequences of NTAs is not clear to all stakeholders. Substantial data show elevated antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with animals fed NTAs and their food products. This resistance spreads to other animals and humans-directly by contact and indirectly via the food chain, water, air, and manured and sludge-fertilized soils. Modern genetic techniques are making advances in deciphering the ecological impact of NTAs, but modeling efforts are thwarted by deficits in key knowledge of microbial and antibiotic loads at each stage of the transmission chain. Still, the substantial and expanding volume of evidence reporting animal-to-human spread of resistant bacteria, including that arising from use of NTAs, supports eliminating NTA use in order to reduce the growing environmental load of resistance genes.},

abstract = {Eighty-nine Escherichia coli isolates recovered from faeces of red deer and small mammals, cohabiting the same area, were analyzed to determine the prevalence and mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance and molecular typing. Antimicrobial resistance was detected in 6.7{\%} of isolates, with resistances to tetracycline and quinolones being the most common. An E. coli strain carrying blaCTX-M-1 as well as other antibiotic resistant genes included in an unusual class 1 integron (Intl1-dfrA16-blaPSE-1-aadA2-cmlA1-aadA1-qacH-IS440-sul3-orf1-mef(B)??-IS26) was isolated from a deer. The blaCTX-M-1 gene was transferred by conjugation and transconjugants also acquired an IncN plasmid. This strain was typed as ST224, which seems to be well adapted to both clinical and environmental settings. The phylogenetic distribution of the 89 strains varied depending on the animal host. This work reveals low antimicrobial resistance levels among faecal E. coli from wild mammals, which reflects a lower selective pressure affecting these bacteria, compared to livestock. However, it is remarkable the detection of a multi-resistant ESBL-E. coli with an integron carrying clinically relevant antibiotic-resistance genes, which can contribute to the dissemination of resistance determinants among different ecosystems.},

abstract = {During the past 15 years, emergence and dissemination of beta-lactam resistance in nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, became a serious problem worldwide. Especially the increasing resistance to 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins and carbapenems is of particular concern. Gram-negative bacteria pursue various molecular strategies for development of resistance to these antibiotics: (a) generation of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) according to the original definition due to extension of the spectrum of already widely disseminated plasmid-encoded beta-lactamases by amino acid substitution; (b) acquisition of genes encoding ESBL from environmental bacteria as, for instance the CTX-M-type beta-lactamases from Kluyvera spp.; (c) high-level expression of chromosome-encoded beta-lactamase (bla) genes as bla(OXA) or bla(ampC) genes due to modifications in regulatory genes, mutations of the beta-lactamase promoter sequence as well as integration of insertion sequences containing an efficient promoter for intrinsic bla genes; (d) mobilization of bla genes by incorporation in integrons and horizontal transfer into other Gram-negative species such as the transfer of the ampC gene from Citrobacter freundii to Klebsiella spp.; (e) dissemination of plasmid-mediated carbapenemases as KPC and metallo-beta-lactamases, e.g. VIM and IMP; (f) non-expression of porin genes and/or efflux pump-based antibiotic resistance. This mini-review summarizes the historical emergence of beta-lactam resistance and beta-lactamases as major resistance mechanism in enteric bacteria, and also highlights recent developments such as multidrug- and carbapenem resistance.},

abstract = {There is urgent need to develop novel treatment strategies to reduce antimicrobial resistance. Collateral sensitivity (CS), where resistance to one antimicrobial increases susceptibility to other drugs, might enable selection against resistance during treatment. However, the success of this approach would depend on the conservation of CS networks across genetically diverse bacterial strains. Here, we examine CS conservation across diverse Escherichia coli strains isolated from urinary tract infections. We determine collateral susceptibilities of mutants resistant to relevant antimicrobials against 16 antibiotics. Multivariate statistical analyses show that resistance mechanisms, in particular efflux-related mutations, as well as the relative fitness of resistant strains, are principal contributors to collateral responses. Moreover, collateral responses shift the mutant selection window, suggesting that CS-informed therapies may affect evolutionary trajectories of antimicrobial resistance. Our data allow optimism for CS-informed therapy and further suggest that rapid detection of resistance mechanisms is important to accurately predict collateral responses.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli at Dutch broiler farms and in farmers and to compare ESBL/AmpC-producing isolates from farmers and their animals. METHODS: Twenty-five to 41 cloacal swabs collected from broilers at each of 26 farms and 18 faecal samples from 18 broiler farmers were analysed for determination of the presence of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli. ESBL/AmpC genes were characterized by microarray, PCR and sequencing. Plasmids were characterized by transformation and PCR-based replicon typing. Subtyping of plasmids was done by plasmid multilocus sequence typing or restriction fragment length polymorphism. E. coli genotypes were determined by multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: Birds from all farms were positive for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli, and on 22/26 farms the within-farm prevalence was {\textgreater}/= 80{\%}. Six of 18 farmers carried isolates containing ESBL/AmpC genes bla(CTX-M-1), bla(CMY-2) and/or bla(SHV-12), which were also present in the samples from their animals. In five of these isolates, the genes were located on identical plasmid families [IncI1 (n = 3), IncK (n = 1) or IncN (n = 1)], and in isolates from two farmers the genes were carried on identical plasmid subtypes (IncI1 ST12 and IncN ST1, where ST stands for sequence type) as in the isolates from their animals. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a high prevalence of birds carrying ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli at Dutch broiler farms and a high prevalence of ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in farmers. This is undesirable due to the risk this poses to human health. Future research should focus on identification of the source of these isolates in the broiler production chain to make interventions resulting in reduction of these isolates possible.},

abstract = {Epidemiologists frequently study the experience of a population over time to estimate the association between exposure and outcome. These studies generally use case-control, prospective cohort, or retrospective cohort designs. The "cross-sectional cohort study," as it is termed here, represents an alternative to these standard methods. With this design, an investigator samples a source population cross-sectionally and then retrospectively assesses subjects' histories of exposures and outcomes over a specified time period. Certain threats to validity, such as nonignorable exiting and measurement error from retrospective assessments, must be considered carefully when using this design. However, in some situations, the cross-sectional cohort design may offer advantages over traditional designs - especially in studies in which there is a long interval between exposures and outcomes, in which exposures and outcomes can be accurately assessed retrospectively, and in which the outcome does not accelerate any exiting from the population. Such situations often arise when studying chronic or episodic conditions with low mortality, such as psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {Antigenic macromolecules present in food can induce inflammatory allergic reaction in sensitized persons. The aim of the present work is the development of an animal model to detect food antigens based on hypersensitivity reaction after food ingestion. New Zealand rabbits were divided in 5 groups. Group 1 (GI): control. G2: Ovalbumin (OVA) sensitized. G3: sensitized and orally challenged with OVA. G4: OVA sensitized and phosphate buffer solution challenged (PBS). G5: sensitized and challenged with OVA. Samples from cecum were stained with Alcian Blue pH {\textless} 1 for mast cells and with silver method for enteroendocrine cells (EEC). Other samples were immunostained with anti CD5 and CD25 monoclonal antibodies. Specific IgE levels were detected by PCA. Histopathology of G5 showed patchy edema, lymphangiectasia and eosinophilic infiltration. Results were expressed as cells per HPF (high power field); Mast cells in G1: 1.33; G2: 12.80 and G5: 10.20. Enteroendocrine cells in surface epithelium: G1: 1.6; G2: 6.0; G5: 4.2 and in deep epithelium: G1: 3.0; G2: 12.0 and G5: 7.3. Lymphocytes CD5+ in G1: 24.21: G2: 22.12 and G5: 23.97 and CD25+ in G1: 12.10: G2: 14.30 and G5: 21.68. Group 3 were similar to G1 and G4 to G2. We observed: mast cells increased in number probably due to OVA induced response. EEC showed an increase in sensitized animals because of higher expression of cytoplasmatic granules or differentiation from stem cells. Decrease in EEC number in challenged groups was likely to be based on vesicles release. Total T cells showed no significant differences among groups. CD 25+ cells were higher in sensitized and challenged animals. We concluded that rabbit model of sensitization and oral challenge is valid to study ingested food antigens and potential digestive pathologic reactions.},

@article{Montero2001a,
abstract = {The fluoroquinolones (FQ) are used in the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the development of resistance could limit their effectiveness. FQ resistance (FQ(R)) is a multistep process involving alterations in the type II topoisomerases and perhaps in the regulation of efflux pumps, but several of the steps remain unidentified. Recombinant plasmid pGADIV was selected from a genomic library of wild-type (WT), FQ-sensitive M. smegmatis by its ability to confer low-level resistance to sparfloxacin (SPX). In WT M. smegmatis, pGADIV increased the MICs of ciprofloxacin (CIP) by fourfold and of SPX by eightfold, and in M. bovis BCG it increased the MICs of both CIP and SPX by fourfold. It had no effect on the accumulation of (14)C-labeled CIP or SPX. The open reading frame responsible for the increase in FQ(R), mfpA, encodes a putative protein belonging to the family of pentapeptides, in which almost every fifth amino acid is either leucine or phenylalanine. Very similar proteins are also present in M. tuberculosis and M. avium. The MICs of CIP and SPX were lower for an M. smegmatis mutant strain lacking an intact mfpA gene than for the WT strain, suggesting that, by some unknown mechanism, the gene product plays a role in determining the innate level of FQ(R) in M. smegmatis.},

All isolates with a MIC of nalidixic acid of {\textgreater} or = 128 micrograms/ml showed a mutation at amino acid codon Ser-83. Only 1 of the 27 clinical isolates of E. coli analyzed showed a change in Lys-447 of the B subunit of DNA gyrase.

abstract = {Although over 50 complete Escherichia coli/Shigella genome sequences are available, it is only for closely related strains, for example the O55:H7 and O157:H7 clones of E. coli, that we can assign differences to individual evolutionary events along specific lineages. Here we sequence the genomes of 14 isolates of a uropathogenic E. coli clone that persisted for 3 years within a household, including a dog, causing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in the dog after 2 years. The 20 mutations observed fit a single tree that allows us to estimate the mutation rate to be about 1.1 per genome per year, with minimal evidence for adaptive change, including in relation to the UTI episode. The host data also imply at least 6 host transfer events over the 3 years, with 2 lineages present over much of that period. To our knowledge, these are the first direct measurements for a clone in a well-defined host community that includes rates of mutation and host transmission. There is a concentration of non-synonymous mutations associated with 2 transfers to the dog, suggesting some selection pressure from the change of host. However, there are no changes to which we can attribute the UTI event in the dog, which suggests that this occurrence after 2 years of the clone being in the household may have been due to chance, or some unknown change in the host or environment. The ability of a UTI strain to persist for 2 years and also to transfer readily within a household has implications for epidemiology, diagnosis, and clinical intervention.},

Eighty fecal samples of food-producing animals (23 sheep, 22 chickens, 22 cattle, six horses, five rabbits, and two dromedaries) were obtained from 35 different farms in Tunisia in 2011. Samples were inoculated onto MacConkey agar plates supplemented with cefotaxime (2 mg/L) for cefotaxime-resistant (CTX(R)) E. coli recovery. CTX(R) E. coli isolates were detected in 11 out of 80 samples (13.8{\%}), and one isolate per sample was further characterized (10 from chickens and one from a dromedary). The 11 CTX(R) isolates were distributed into phylogroups: B1 (five isolates), A (two isolates), D (three isolates), and B2 (one isolate). The following beta-lactamase genes were detected: bla(CTX-M-1) (seven isolates), bla(CTX-M-1)+bla(TEM-135) (one isolate), bla(CTX-M-1)+bla(TEM-1b) (one isolate), and bla(CMY-2) (two isolates). All ESBL- and pAmpC-BL-producing E. coli strains showed unrelated pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. Seven isolates contained class 1 integrons with four gene cassette arrangements: dfrA17-aadA5 (three isolates), dfrA1-aadA1 (two isolates), dfrA15-aadA1 (one isolate), and aadA1 (one isolate). All isolates showed tetracycline resistance and contained the tet(A) +/- tet(B) genes. Virulence genes detected were as follows (number of isolates in parentheses): fimA (10); aer (eight); papC (two); and papGIII, hly, cnf, and bfp (none). Chicken farms constitute a reservoir of ESBL- and pAmpC-BL-producing E. coli isolates of the CTX-M-1 and CMY-2 types that potentially could be transmitted to humans via the food chain or by direct contact.},

@article{Tenover2006,
abstract = {The treatment of bacterial infections is increasingly complicated by the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial agents are often categorized according to their principal mechanism of action. Mechanisms include interference with cell wall synthesis (e.g., beta-lactams and glycopeptide agents), inhibition of protein synthesis (macrolides and tetracyclines), interference with nucleic acid synthesis (fluoroquinolones and rifampin), inhibition of a metabolic pathway (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and disruption of bacterial membrane structure (polymyxins and daptomycin). Bacteria may be intrinsically resistant to {\textgreater} or =1 class of antimicrobial agents, or may acquire resistance by de novo mutation or via the acquisition of resistance genes from other organisms. Acquired resistance genes may enable a bacterium to produce enzymes that destroy the antibacterial drug, to express efflux systems that prevent the drug from reaching its intracellular target, to modify the drug's target site, or to produce an alternative metabolic pathway that bypasses the action of the drug. Acquisition of new genetic material by antimicrobial-susceptible bacteria from resistant strains of bacteria may occur through conjugation, transformation, or transduction, with transposons often facilitating the incorporation of the multiple resistance genes into the host's genome or plasmids. Use of antibacterial agents creates selective pressure for the emergence of resistant strains. Herein 3 case histories-one involving Escherichia coli resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, another focusing on the emergence of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and a third detailing multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa--are reviewed to illustrate the varied ways in which resistant bacteria develop.},

@article{Soufi2013,
abstract = {Integrons are important genetic elements implicated in acquisition and expression of antimicrobial resistance genes. Gene cassettes of class 1 integrons may be differently expressed depending on the Pc promoter variant. Thirty-four Escherichia coli isolates (carrying 38 class 1 integrons), recovered from poultry meat in previous studies in Tunisia and selected by their specific traits, were further characterized in this study. Integron promoter variants and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of isolates were determined. Three types of promoter variants were identified among the 38 class 1 integrons (PcW, PcH1, and PcS); the weak promoters were the most predominant. A high clonal diversity of the E. coli strains was demonstrated by PFGE or by MLST. Fifteen PFGE profiles were detected among 19 integron-positive isolates of phylogroup B2, and 12 different sequence types were identified by MLST among the remaining 15 isolates (ST48, ST88, ST101, ST117, ST155, ST189, ST351, ST359, ST410, ST641, ST665, and one new ST). These data reflect that the presence of integrons in these isolates is not due to the clonal dispersion but to dissemination of genetic structures carrying integrons in different clones. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report examining the gene cassette promoter variants in class 1 integrons of E. coli isolates from poultry meat origin. The predominance of promoters implicated in weak expression/high excision activity of gene cassette arrays is of interest because they could theoretically enhance the capacity of integrons to adapt to antibiotic pressure.},

abstract = {AIM: To determine if disinfecting footbaths in the food industry were contaminated with bacteria and to characterize some of the bacteria present. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bacterial strains were isolated from disinfecting footbaths containing TEGO 103G (amphoteric disinfectant) or TP-99 (alkyl amino acetate-based disinfectant) in five of six dairy factories. Fourteen strains identified as Cedecea spp. by their fatty acid composition were further characterized. Results from Rapid ID 32 E API analysis and 16S-rDNA-sequencing showed that all strains were Serratia marcescens. Unlike S. marcescens ATCC 13880, the isolates from disinfecting footbaths were not killed ({\textless}5 log10 reduction) by the recommended in-use concentration of TEGO 103G, TEGO 51 or benzalkonium chloride. Survival and multiplication in tap water with an in-use concentration of TEGO 103G was demonstrated for one of the strains. All strains were killed by the in-use concentrations of commercial disinfectants based on peracetic acid, hypochlorite, quaternary ammonium compounds and alkyl amino acetate (TP-99). There were no indications of cross-resistance between disinfectants and antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Serratia marcescens may survive and multiply in disinfecting footbaths containing TEGO 103G or alkyl amino acetate because of disinfectant resistance. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Disinfecting footbaths may act as contamination sources in food factories and should not be used without regular hygienic monitoring.},

These plasmids belong to families that are largely prevalent in naturally occurring bacteria, usually carry multiple physically linked genetic determinants, conferring resistance to different classes of antibiotics simultaneously. Plasmids also harbour virulence factors and addiction systems, promoting their stability and maintenance in the bacterial host, in different environmental conditions.

abstract = {The emergence of antibiotic resistance is a defining challenge, and Escherichia coli is recognized as one of the leading species resistant to the antimicrobials used in human or veterinary medicine. Here, we analyse the distribution of 2172 antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) genes in 4022 E. coli to provide a population-level view of resistance in this species. By separating the resistance determinants into 'core' (those found in all strains) and 'accessory' (those variably present) determinants, we have found that, surprisingly, almost half of all E. coli do not encode any accessory resistance determinants. However, those strains that do encode accessory resistance are significantly more likely to be resistant to multiple antibiotic classes than would be expected by chance. Furthermore, by studying the available date of isolation for the E. coli genomes, we have visualized an expanding, highly interconnected network that describes how resistances to antimicrobials have co-associated within genomes over time. These data can be exploited to reveal antimicrobial combinations that are less likely to be found together, and so if used in combination may present an increased chance of suppressing the growth of bacteria and reduce the rate at which resistance factors are spread. Our study provides a complex picture of AMR in the E. coli population. Although the incidence of resistance to all studied antibiotic classes has increased dramatically over time, there exist combinations of antibiotics that could, in theory, attack the entirety of E. coli, effectively removing the possibility that discrete AMR genes will increase in frequency in the population.},

abstract = {Representative plasmids for most incompatibility groups in Escherichia coli K-12 were transferred to a "bald" strain to compare transfer frequencies for liquid and solid media. Standard broth matings were used for a liquid environment, but for solid surface mating, conjugation was allowed to take place on nutrient plates before washing off the cells for transconjugant selection on plates containing appropriate drugs. Plasmids that determine rigid pili transferred at least 2,000x better on plates than in broth. Some plasmids that determine thick flexible pili transferred 45 to 470x better, whereas others transferred equally well in both environments, as did plasmids of the I complex, which determine thin flexible pili. These results clearly distinguished a number of surface mating systems where most plasmids were derepressed for transfer and determined conjugative pili constitutively. The temperature-independent IncH2 plasmid R831b transferred best on plates, but other IncH plasmids transferred equally well in broth. This inconsistency led to the reclassification of R831b as IncM.},

METHODS AND RESULTS: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli isolates were found on 8 (20{\%}) of 40 turkey farms surveyed. A total of 200 environmental smears were examined, and a total of 25 ESBL-producing E. coli were isolated. These isolates were analysed using XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and divided into nine pulsotypes. Most of the isolates harboured the gene bla(SHV-12) on a 40-kb plasmid of the IncFII group with an identical EcoRV restriction profile. Indistinguishable or clonally related SHV-12-producing isolates belonging to the same pulsotypes were found at some unrelated farms. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli isolates with bla(SHV-12) carried on IncFII plasmids in meat production flocks in the Czech Republic was demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results indicate vertical transmission of ESBL-producing E. coli within the turkey production pyramid.

Cattle are the main reservoir of STEC and transmission to humans occurs through contaminated food and water. Antibiotics are used in pig production systems to combat disease and improve productivity and play a key role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes to the bacteria. Integrons have been identified in resistant bacteria allowing for the acquisition and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes. STEC strains isolated from humans and animals have developed antibiotic resistance. In our laboratory, 21 non-157 STEC strains isolated from pigs were analyzed to detect class 1 and 2 integrons by PCR. Eight carried integrons, 7 of them harbored intl2. In another study 545 STEC strains were also analyzed for the presence of intl1 and intl2 . Strains carrying intl1 belonged to isolates from environment (n = 1), chicken hamburger (n = 2), dairy calves (n = 4) and pigs (n = 8). Two strains isolated from pigs harbored intl2 and only one intl1 / intl2 , highlighting the presence of intl2 in pigs. The selection for multiresistant strains may contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens and facilitate the spreading of the mobile resistance elements to other bacteria.},

abstract = {Comparative whole-genome analyses have demonstrated that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) provides a significant contribution to prokaryotic genome innovation. The evolution of specific prokaryotes is therefore tightly linked to the environment in which they live and the communal pool of genes available within that environment. Here we use the term supergenome to describe the set of all genes that a prokaryotic 'individual' can draw on within a particular environmental setting. Conjugative plasmids can be considered particularly successful entities within the communal pool, which have enabled HGT over large taxonomic distances. These plasmids are collections of discrete regions of genes that function as 'backbone modules' to undertake different aspects of overall plasmid maintenance and propagation. Conjugative plasmids often carry suites of 'accessory elements' that contribute adaptive traits to the hosts and, potentially, other resident prokaryotes within specific environmental niches. Insight into the evolution of plasmid modules therefore contributes to our knowledge of gene dissemination and evolution within prokaryotic communities. This communal pool provides the prokaryotes with an important mechanistic framework for obtaining adaptability and functional diversity that alleviates the need for large genomes of specialized 'private genes'.},

abstract = {The field of antibiotic drug discovery and the monitoring of new antibiotic resistance elements have yet to fully exploit the power of the genome revolution. Despite the fact that the first genomes sequenced of free living organisms were those of bacteria, there have been few specialized bioinformatic tools developed to mine the growing amount of genomic data associated with pathogens. In particular, there are few tools to study the genetics and genomics of antibiotic resistance and how it impacts bacterial populations, ecology, and the clinic. We have initiated development of such tools in the form of the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database (CARD; http://arpcard.mcmaster.ca). The CARD integrates disparate molecular and sequence data, provides a unique organizing principle in the form of the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), and can quickly identify putative antibiotic resistance genes in new unannotated genome sequences. This unique platform provides an informatic tool that bridges antibiotic resistance concerns in health care, agriculture, and the environment.},

abstract = {During recent years a rapid increase of quinolone resistant Escherichia coli have been noted in the Swedish broiler population, despite the lack of a known selective pressure. The current study wanted to investigate if imported breeding birds could be a source for the quinolone resistant E. coli. The occurrence of quinolone resistant E. coli was investigated, using selective cultivation with nalidixic acid, in grand-parent birds on arrival to Sweden and their progeny. In addition, sampling in hatcheries and empty cleaned poultry houses was performed. Clonality of isolates was investigated using a 10-loci multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). To identify the genetic basis for the resistance isolates were also analysed for occurrence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants and characterization of chromosomal mutations. E. coli resistant to nalidixic acid occurred in grandparent birds imported to Sweden for breeding purposes. Four predominant MLVA types were identified in isolates from grandparent birds, parent birds and broilers. However, resistant E. coli with identical MLVA patterns were also present in hatcheries and poultry houses suggesting that the environment plays a role in the occurrence. Nalidixic acid resistance was due to a mutation in the gyrA gene and no PMQR could be identified. The occurrence of identical clones in all levels of the production pyramid points to that quinolone resistant E. coli can be introduced through imported breeding birds and spread by vertical transmission to all levels of the broiler production pyramid.},

@article{Lopatkin2016,
abstract = {It is generally assumed that antibiotics can promote horizontal gene transfer. However, because of a variety of confounding factors that complicate the interpretation of previous studies, the mechanisms by which antibiotics modulate horizontal gene transfer remain poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear whether antibiotics directly regulate the efficiency of horizontal gene transfer, serve as a selection force to modulate population dynamics after such gene transfer has occurred, or both. Here, we address this question by quantifying conjugation dynamics in the presence and absence of antibiotic-mediated selection. Surprisingly, we find that sublethal concentrations of antibiotics from the most widely used classes do not significantly increase the conjugation efficiency. Instead, our modelling and experimental results demonstrate that conjugation dynamics are dictated by antibiotic-mediated selection, which can both promote and suppress conjugation dynamics. Our findings suggest that the contribution of antibiotics to the promotion of horizontal gene transfer may have been overestimated. These findings have implications for designing effective antibiotic treatment protocols and for assessing the risks of antibiotic use. H orizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a main contributor to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes 1â3 . Conversely, it has been generally assumed that antibiotics promote HGT 4,5 . One of the most common mechanisms for HGT, particularly for the transfer of plasmids such as those carrying antibiotic resistance, is conjugation 2,6,7 . There are two broad ways in which antibiotics can promote HGT via conjugation. First, when dosed at sublethal con-centrations, antibiotics can increase the conjugation rate by either activating the excision of transferrable genes from the host chromo-some or by inducing the expression of conjugation machinery (or both) 8â12 . Second, it has been speculated, but not proven, that anti-biotics can cause global cellular responses, such as changes in cell wall composition or upregulation of key survival genes 13,14 , which can indirectly increase the conjugation rate 15â17},
