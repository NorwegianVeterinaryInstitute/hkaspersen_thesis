## Laboratory methods

### Isolate information
All _E. coli_ isolates included in this study were isolated through the NORM-VET programme, and the methods used for isolating _E. coli_ and susceptibility testing is described in Section \@ref(norwmonitor).

### DNA isolation and sequencing
QREC isolates were plated onto MacConkey agar with 0.06 mg/L ciprofloxacin to confirm resistance. DNA was isolated from pure bacterial cultures using the QIAmp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). DNA quality was measured on a NanoDrop^TM^ One spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and DNA concentration was measured with a broad-range DNA Qubit assay (Qiagen). DNA integrity was assessed by gel electrophoresis and/or on a Fragment Analyser^TM^ Automated CE System Instrument (FSV2-DE2-100, Advanced Analytical).

The Nextera XT/Flex (Illumina) library preparation kits were used for preparing the libraries for sequencing. Sequencing was done on Illumina HiSeq platforms, either Hiseq 2000, Hiseq 2500 rapid run, Hiseq 3/4000, or Hiseq X. The sequencing and library preparation service was provided by the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (NSC, www.sequencing.uio.no), a national technology platform hosted by the University of Oslo and supported by the "Functional Genomics" and "Infrastructure" programs of the Research Council of Norway and the Southeastern Regional Health Authorities. Both library preparation and sequencing was performed by NSC.

## Genomic analysis methods
### Quality control, genome assembly and annotation
All raw reads in this study were quality controlled with FastQC (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Possible contaminant reads were identified with Mash screen [@Ondov2016]. Residual phiX was removed with bbduk (https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/bbtools/) by mapping reads to the phiX genome (NC_001422.1). Unmapped sequences were then trimmed with trimmomatic [@Bolger2014].

### Clustering and phylogenetic analysis
Multi locus sequence typing (MLST) and core genome MLST (cgMLST) was used to get an overview of the relatedness between isolates. The "_Escherichia coli_ #1" scheme was used for MLST [@Wirth2006], and the cgMLST scheme was downloaded from Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/1323690#.XMqp8ZgzZaQ) [@Alikhan2018]. Both schemes were hosted by EnteroBase. Pairwise distances were calculated from the cgMLST alleles and clustered in R.
