# Materials and Methods

Here follows a summary of methods used - for details, see enclosed articles.

<!-- Chapter 1  -->
## Laboratory methods

All _E. coli_ isolates included in this study were isolated through the NORM-VET programme, and the methods used for isolating _E. coli_ and susceptibility testing is described in Section \@ref(norwmonitor). An _E. coli_ was categorized as quinolone resistant if the MIC value for ciprofloxacin was above 0.06 mg/L.

DNA was extracted from pure bacterial cultures of the isolates included in article II and III. Library preparation and sequencing service was provided by the Norwegian Sequencing Centre (NSC, www.sequencing.uio.no), a national technology platform hosted by the University of Oslo and supported by the "Functional Genomics" and "Infrastructure" programs of the Research Council of Norway and the Southeastern Regional Health Authorities.

## Genomic analysis methods
Parts of the genomic analysis was performed on the Abel Cluster, owned by the University of Oslo and Uninett/Sigma2, and operated by the Department for Research Computing at USIT, the University of Oslo IT-department (www.hpc.uio.no/). The rest of the analyses was performed in R [@R-base].

### Quality control
All raw reads in this study were quality controlled with FastQC [@BabrahamBioinformatics2018]. Possible contaminant reads were identified with Mash screen [@Ondov2016]. Residual phiX was removed with bbduk [@Bushnell2019] by mapping reads to the phiX genome (NC_001422.1). Unmapped sequences were then trimmed with trimmomatic [@Bolger2014].

### Gene and variant detection {#aribaflag}
ARIBA was used to determine the sequence types of the isolates, with the _E. coli_ scheme hosted by Enterobase [@Wirth2006].
ARIBA was also used to identify acquired resistance genes with the resfinder database [@Zankari2012], and mutations in intrinsic genes with the MEGARes database [@Lakin2017]. All ARIBA flags which fulfilled the following criteria was accepted (see github.com/sanger-pathogens/ariba/wiki/Task:-flag for details):

- At least 95% of the reference sequence matches the assembly on only one contig

- No ambiguity in the scaffolding graph

An R script was used to select the genes or variants that fulfilled these criteria (www.github.com/hkaspersen/VAMPIR).

The mutator genes _dam, mutD, mutH, mutL, mutM, mutS, mutT, mutY_, and _uvrD_ were investigated in regards to mutations that lead to amino acid changes in the encoded proteins. The sequences were retrieved from each isolate using BLAST [@Altschul1990]. Mutations were detected by comparing to the _E. coli_ K12 versions of the genes.

### Assembly, annotation and pan-genome analysis
SPAdes [@Bankevich2012] was used to assemble the genomes from the trimmed reads, filtering out contigs smaller than 500 bp. Pilon [@Walker2014] was used to correct potential errors that arose in the assembly process. Prokka [@Seemann2014] was used to annotate the pilon-corrected genomes. Quast [@Gurevich2013] was used to assess the error-corrected assemblies. A pan-genome analysis was done using Roary [@Page2015], which was also used to create a core gene alignment. 

### Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis methods are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:flowchart). In article II, the left pathway in Figure \@ref(fig:flowchart) was used to generate an overview tree of all the isolates. Then, clades were selected for further analysis based on low genetic divergence, animal species, and geographical location. These isolate groups were then analysed with the rightmost pathway. In article III, only the left pathway was used, excluding the patristic distances.

## Statistical methods
Statistical analysis was done in R version 3.4.2 (Article 1) and `r version$version.string` (Article 2 and 3) [@R-base].
Significant differences between groups was calculated by using $\chi$^2^-test. Confidence intervals were calculated by using the two-sided exact binomial test at 95% confidence level.

To identify whether isolates from one animal species were more closely related than isolates from other animal species, the median minimum SNP distance to closest isolate from the same animal species was calculated. A randomization test with 1000 iterations was performed to investigate whether isolates from each animal species were more aggregated in the tree than randomly expected. For each iteration the median minimum SNP distance for isolates belonging to the same species was calculated, and non-exact p-values were calculated based on the number of expected values below the observed value for all iterations.

Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to cluster isolates based on presence/absence of quinolone resistance conferring substitutions and genes by using the vegan package [@R-vegan]. A stressplot was used to determine goodness of fit [@R-vegan].
