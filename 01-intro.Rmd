## Background of project
Little to no quinolones or fluoroquinolones are used in Norwegian food production animals. Nonetheless, low levels of Quinolone Resistant _E. coli_ have been observed in a high proportion of the samples after screening with a selective method in the Norwegian monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance [@NORM/NORM-VET2016]
