# Introduction

When did the project start?

## Antimicrobial resistance
Background information on antimicrobial resistance in general, health threats, epidemiology, etc.

## Quinolones and fluoroquinolones

Quinolones are synthetic antimicrobials that were introduced to the market in the late 1960s [@Emmerson2003]. The first quinolone, Nalidixic acid, was discovered as a byproduct of chloroquine synthesis [@Lesher1962], and was clinically in use in 1967. A few decades later, the fluoroquinolones were created, by adding various elements to the Nalidixic acid molecule.

## Quinolone resistance mechanisms

Multiple resistance mechanisms towards quinolones and fluoroquinolones have been discovered in _E. coli_. These mechanisms can be divided into three categories: Alteration of drug target, expression of plasmid-mediated proteins, and reduced drug accumulation [@Aldred2014a].

### Alteration of drug targets
Perhaps the most established mechanism is alteration of the drug targets: the _gyrA_, _gyrB_, _parC_, _parE_ genes. Specifically, mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) leads to decreased susceptibility towards these compounds [@Yoshida1991]. In _gyrA_, mutations in the amino acid residues serine 83 and aspartic acid 87 have been shown to increase resistance to quinolones [@Barnard2001].

### Expression of plasmid-mediated proteins
Plasmid-mediated _qnr_-genes, _mfp_-genes, _mcbG_. Compromised structure of the quinolone molecule by the acetyltransferase _aac(6')-ib-cr_.

### Reduced drug accumulation
Over-expression of efflux pumps and reduced expression of porins (Mutations in _marR_, plasmid-mediated efflux pumps: _oqxAB_).

## Bioinformatics
Ever since the eve of high-throughput sequencing platforms in the early 2000s, bioinformatics have become increasingly needed to handle the massive amount of generated data. Bioinformatics can be defined as the use of informatics techniques, such as mathematics, statistics and computer science, to understand biological data on a large scale [@Luscombe2001]. In most cases, DNA or protein sequences represent the biological data, but gene expression data can also be analysed. 

## Background of project
Little to no quinolones or fluoroquinolones are used in Norwegian food production animals. Nonetheless, low levels of Quinolone Resistant _E. coli_ have been observed in a high proportion of the samples after screening with a selective method in the Norwegian monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance [@NORM/NORM-VET2016]
