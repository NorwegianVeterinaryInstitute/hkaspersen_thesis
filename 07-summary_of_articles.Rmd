The aim of the study was to describe and compare the occurrence of quinolone resistant _E. coli_ in various animal species in relation to human population density. Data from 4568 _E. coli_ isolates from the Norwegian monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in feed, food and animals from 2006 to 2016 was compiled and analysed. The isolates originated from broilers, layers, cattle, turkeys, dogs, wild birds, red foxes, reindeer, sheep, horses and pigs. Data on the geographical location of origin for the isolates was available for 4050 isolates, and was used to categorize the isolates depending on the human population density of the area. In total, 1.4 % of the isolates were regarded as quinolone resistant, where the highest occurrence was in broilers and wild birds. Human population density was not associated with the occurrence of quinolone resistant _E. coli_. In Norway, fluoroquinolones are not used prophylactically and in almost negligent amounts in various species. This, and the observed interspecies variation, suggests other factors than fluoroquinolone use may be important in the development of quinolone resistant _E. coli_.

Emergence of quinolone resistant Escherichia coli (QREC) has been attributed to both dissemination of exogenous strains as well as the spontaneous development of resistance in the intestinal microbiota. In Norway, QREC has been detected using a selective method in a high proportion of samples from various animal species. This was unexpected, as the usage of quinolones in Norwegian livestock is regarded as negligible, and the source of this emergence is currently unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize quinolone resistance mechanisms present in QREC from different animal species and to identify possible dissemination of QREC strains. A total of 285 QREC isolates, from broilers, pigs, red foxes and wild birds, were whole genome sequenced. Genes and amino acid substitutions conferring quinolone resistance were identified by mapping reads to reference databases, and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was generated from aligned core genes. The detected quinolone resistance mechanisms agreed with previously described mechanisms, and the resistance mechanism patterns appeared to follow sequence type groups. Similar QREC isolates with similar resistance mechanism patterns were detected in multiple species, and further phylogenetic analysis indicated close evolutionary relationships between some isolates. This suggests dissemination of highly similar QREC isolates between animal species, and also potential persistence, particularly within the broiler and pig production chains.
