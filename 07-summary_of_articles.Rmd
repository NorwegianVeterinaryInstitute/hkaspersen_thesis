The aim of the study was to describe and compare the occurrence of quinolone resistant _E. coli_ in various animal species in relation to human population density. Data from 4568 _E. coli_ isolates from the Norwegian monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in feed, food and animals from 2006 to 2016 was compiled and analysed. The isolates originated from broilers, layers, cattle, turkeys, dogs, wild birds, red foxes, reindeer, sheep, horses and pigs. Data on the geographical location of origin for the isolates was available for 4050 isolates, and was used to categorize the isolates depending on the human population density of the area. In total, 1.4 % of the isolates were regarded as quinolone resistant, where the highest occurrence was in broilers and wild birds. Human population density was not associated with the occurrence of quinolone resistant _E. coli_. In Norway, fluoroquinolones are not used prophylactically and in almost negligent amounts in various species. This, and the observed interspecies variation, suggests other factors than fluoroquinolone use may be important in the development of quinolone resistant _E. coli_.

In Norway, the use of quinolones in livestock populations is very low, and prophylactic use is prohibited. Despite this, quinolone resistant E. coli (QREC) are present in multiple animal species, though in low levels. The source of these QREC is unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize and compare QREC from different animal species to identify putative factors that may promote the occurrence of QREC. A total of 280 QREC isolates, from broilers, pigs, red foxes and wild birds, were sequenced and analysed. Genes and mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions conferring quinolone resistance were identified by mapping reads to genes in reference databases. Phylogenetic analyses was used to determine the relationships between the isolates. Novel amino acid substitutions were detected in RpoB, MarR and MarA. Quinolone resistance mechanism patterns appeared to follow sequence type groups. Similar QREC isolates with similar resistance mechanism patterns were detected in multiple species, and further phylogenetic analysis indicated close evolutionary relationships between some isolates. This suggests dissemination of highly similar QREC isolates between animal species, and also potential persistence of QREC strains, particularly within the broiler and pig production chains. This highlights the importance of both control measures at the top of the production chain, as well as biosecurity measures to avoid further dissemination and persistence of QREC in these environments. 

**3. Comparative genome analyses of wild type- and quinolone resistant Escherichia coli indicate dissemination of QREC in the broiler production pyramid and potential sporadic local resistance development**

Quinolones are important antimicrobials for both humans and animals, and resistance towards these compounds is a serious threat to public health. In Norway, quinolone resistant E. coli (QREC) have been detected in a high proportion of broiler flocks, even without the use of quinolones. Due to the pyramidal structure of the broiler production chain, QREC isolates may be disseminated from grandparent animals down through the pyramid. However, wild type E. coli may develop quinolone resistance by gaining specific chromosomal mutations, or by acquiring plasmid mediated quinolone resistance genes horizontally. The goal of this study was to determine whether QREC is disseminated through the broiler production pyramid or develops locally at some stage in the broiler production chain. For this purpose, we whole genome sequenced both wild type- and QREC isolates from broiler and parent flocks isolated in the Norwegian monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in feed, food and animals (NORM-VET) between 2006 and 2017, from 22 different production sites. The isolates’ genomes were subjected to phylogenetic analysis and resistance mechanism determination. Highly similar QREC isolates within major sequence types from multiple production sites were identified, suggesting dissemination of QREC isolates in the broiler production chain. Additionally, highly similar wild type and QREC isolates were detected from different production sites, which suggested sporadic local resistance development somewhere in the broiler production chain. The results indicate that the source of QREC in the broiler production chain is from dissemination of strains originating from parent or grandparent animals. Furthermore, this highlights the importance of biosecurity measures to prevent further dissemination of QREC strains in the broiler production pyramid.
