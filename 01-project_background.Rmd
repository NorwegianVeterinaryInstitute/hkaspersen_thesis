# Project Background and aims

Quinolone resistance among indicator _E. coli_ from Norwegian food-producing animals is generally low [@NORM/NORM-VET2017]. This may be a consequence of good animal health and the low usage of quinolones [@NORM/NORM-VET2017]. After the introduction of a selective method, QREC was detected in a high proportion of the samples. Because of the low quinolone usage in these animal populations, this occurrence was unexpected, and warranted further investigation into their resistance mechanisms and population dynamics. Insights into the genetic mechanisms is important to understand the underlying cause of resistance, and examining the population dynamics and relationship between isolates may reveal information on their origin or possible dissemination. This information may help prevent further dissemination of QREC within livestock populations and other animal species, and thus help to maintain the favorable situation in Norway. Furthermore, molecular characterization of QREC isolates from a low antimicrobial usage country provides a unique platform where other underlying causes for resistance development than quinolone usage may be investigated.

The aims of this study was to:
- Compare occurrences of QREC in multiple animal species

- Characterize genetic mechanisms that may explain the observed quinolone resistance

- Uncover potential dissemination of QREC isolates and the relationship between them

- Investigate the possibility of spontaneous development of QREC in the gut microbiota
