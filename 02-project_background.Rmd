# Project Background and aims

Quinolone resistance among indicator _E. coli_ from Norwegian food-producing animals is generally low. This is considered to be a consequence of good animal health and of the low usage of quinolones. After the introduction of a selective method in NORM-VET, QREC was detected in a high proportion of the samples. Because of the low quinolone usage in these animal populations, this occurrence was somewhat unexpected, and warranted further investigation into their resistance mechanisms and population dynamics. Insights into the genetic mechanisms is important to understand the underlying cause of resistance, and examining the population dynamics and relationship between isolates may reveal information on their origin or possible dissemination. Data on occurrence, mechanisms and dissemination may provide important information to implement preventive strategies that reduce further dissemination of QREC within livestock populations and other animal species, and thus help to maintain the favorable situation in Norway. Additionally, molecular characterization of QREC isolates from a low antimicrobial usage country provides a unique platform where other underlying causes for resistance development than quinolone usage may be investigated.

The aims of this study was to:

- Summarise and describe existing data on occurrence of quinolone resistance in animal populations

- Characterize genetic mechanisms that may explain the observed quinolone resistance

- Explore potential emergence and dissemination of quinolone resistance in _E. coli_ in livestock populations
