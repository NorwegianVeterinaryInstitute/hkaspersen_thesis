# Future Perspectives

- In-depth characterization using comparative genomics of QREC isolates from Norway and other countries in Europe are needed to further investigate international dissemination of these isolates

- Temporal analysis of QREC occurrence from succeeding sampling from both broiler and breeding houses will provide further data on dissemination and persistence

- Characterization of plasmids harbouring _qnr_ genes are needed to confirm if these plasmids are conjugative, and if they coincide with other resistance genes, especially in samples from pigs

- Further investigate QREC in the Norwegian pig population, as the origin of these isolates are still unknown

- Quantification of QREC in livestock species is important to get a number on the proportion of QREC in the gut of these animals. Knowledge about their normal flora is therefore important, and further studies are needed to gain insight into these aspects
