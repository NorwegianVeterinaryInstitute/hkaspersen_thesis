# Future Perspectives

- In-depth characterization using comparative genomics of QREC isolates from Norway and other countries in Europe are needed to further investigate international dissemination of these isolates

- Characterization of plasmids harbouring _qnr_ genes are needed to confirm if these plasmids are conjugative, and if they coincide with other resistance genes

- Quantification of QREC in livestock species is important to get a number on the proportion of QREC in the gut of these animals. Knowledge about their normal flora is therefore important, and further studies are needed to gain insight into these aspects
