# Future Perspectives

- Investigate QREC isolates from imported birds

- Plasmid characterization in isolates from pigs and wild birds

- Investigate the origins of PMQR, especially qnrB19 in the pig production environment

- Studies on the normal flora in production animals are needed, presumably metagenomics and quiantification of QREC in the gut
