# Conclusions

The overall occurrence of QREC in Norwegian livestock animals is low. The resistance mechanisms identified in this project indicate that the majority of the mechanisms are being clonally disseminated. Horizontally transferrable quinolone resistance seems to be rare in the Norwegian broiler production environment. The results also show QREC dissemination throughout the Norwegian broiler production from higher in the production pyramid. Furthermore, the detection of the same major STs as in other studies on QREC from broilers in Scandinavia give strong indications that the QREC identified in the Norwegian broiler production originate from imported breeding animals. Also, little evidence for the development of quinolone resistance in wild type _E. coli_ further support that dissemination is the major contributor to the occurrence of QREC in the Norwegian broiler production. These findings highlight the importance of biosecurity measures at a higher level in the pyramid, to prevent dissemination down through the Norwegian broiler production environment.
