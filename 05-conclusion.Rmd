# Conclusions

- Low occurrence of QREC in various animal species in Norway

- Significant difference in QREC occurrence between animal species in Norway

- High diversity of QREC in broilers, pigs, red foxes and wild birds in Norway

- Litte PMQR determinants in animals in Norway

- QREC from broilers had a lower intra-species similarity than the other species

- Closely related isolates with similar resistance mechanisms were identified in multiple animal species, indicating dissemination events
