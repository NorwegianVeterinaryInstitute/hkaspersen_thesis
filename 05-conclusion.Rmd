# Conclusions

- The overall occurrence of QREC in Norwegian animal species is low

- The low occurrence of PMQR in the broiler production chain indicate that vertical rather than horizontal dissemination is a major contributor to the observed QREC occurrence in this environment

- Temporal variations in major QREC lineages suggest re-introduction of QREC from a higher level in the pyramid

- The detection of the same major STs as in other studies in Scandinavia give strong indications that the QREC identified in the Norwegian broiler production originate from imported breeding animals
